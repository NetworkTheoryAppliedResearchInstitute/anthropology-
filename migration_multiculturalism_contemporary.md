# Europe: Migration, Multiculturalism, and Contemporary Challenges

---

## Post-WWII Labor Migration

### Guest Workers

**Context:**
- Post-WWII reconstruction (1950s-1960s)
- Labor shortage (economic boom, European workers scarce)
- Solution: Recruit foreign workers

**Germany (*Gastarbeiter*):**
- Recruited: Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal
- "Guest worker" program (1955-1973)
- Assumption: Temporary (workers return home)
- Reality: Many stayed (families joined, children born)
- Turkish community (largest, ~3 million in Germany today)

**France:**
- North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, former colonies)
- Sub-Saharan Africa (Senegal, Mali, others)
- Post-colonial migration (citizenship rights, some)

**Britain:**
- Commonwealth migration (1948 Nationality Act)
- Caribbean (Windrush generation, 1948-1970s)
- South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh)

**Netherlands:**
- Indonesia (former colony, independence 1949)
- Suriname (independence 1975)
- Turkish, Moroccan workers

**Patterns:**
- Initially male workers (remittances sent home)
- Family reunification (1970s+)
- Second generation (born/raised in Europe)
- Permanent settlement (despite "temporary" intent)

---

## Integration vs. Assimilation

### Models

**Assimilation:**
- Immigrants adopt host culture fully
- Language, customs, identity (become "French," "German," etc.)
- France model (Republican universalism, colorblind)

**Multiculturalism:**
- Diversity celebrated (maintain heritage cultures)
- Plural society (coexistence)
- Britain, Netherlands (historically)

**Debates:**
- Which works? (neither perfectly)
- "Integration" = middle ground? (adopt some, retain some)

---

## Citizenship

### Blood vs. Birthplace

**Jus Sanguinis (Blood):**
- Citizenship by descent (parents' nationality)
- Germany (historically, reformed 2000)
- Exclusive (children of immigrants not automatic citizens)

**Jus Soli (Birthplace):**
- Citizenship by birth in territory
- France (with conditions)
- Inclusive (children born there = citizens)

**Naturalization:**
- Requirements: Years of residence, language, tests, "integration"
- Varies by country (strict to lenient)

---

## Second Generation

### Between Two Worlds

**Challenges:**
- Parents' culture vs. host society
- Identity (hyphenated: Turkish-German, French-Algerian)
- Discrimination (labor market, housing, police)
- Marginalization (suburban ghettos, *banlieues* France, *cités*)

**Anthropology:**

**John Bowen:**
- *Why the French Don't Like Headscarves* (2007)
  - France, Islam, secularism (*laïcité*)
  - Headscarf bans (schools 2004, public space debates)
  - Republican universalism vs. religious expression

**Joanna Pfaff-Czarnecka:**
- Switzerland, second generation
- Belonging, multiple identities

---

## Islamophobia and Anti-Immigrant Sentiment

### Rising Hostility

**Triggers:**
- 9/11 (2001): "War on Terror" (Muslims = suspect)
- Madrid bombings (2004)
- London bombings (2005)
- Paris attacks (2015: Charlie Hebdo, Bataclan, stadium)
- Brussels attacks (2016)
- Nice truck attack (2016)
- Many others

**Islamophobia:**
- Prejudice against Muslims (religion, culture, racialized)
- Mosque opposition
- Surveillance, profiling
- Hate crimes

**Far-Right Parties:**
- France: National Rally (formerly National Front, Marine Le Pen)
- Germany: AfD (Alternative for Germany)
- Netherlands: PVV (Geert Wilders)
- Austria: FPÖ
- Italy: Lega Nord, Brothers of Italy
- Sweden Democrats
- Others

**Platforms:**
- Anti-immigration (especially Muslim)
- Nationalism ("Europe for Europeans")
- Anti-EU (some)
- Law and order

**Electoral Success:**
- Growing (2010s-2020s)
- Some in government (Italy, Austria coalition, others)

## 2015-2016 Refugee Crisis

### Syrian Exodus

**Context:**
- Syrian civil war (2011+, see Middle East)
- ~6 million Syrian refugees (neighboring countries overwhelmed)
- 2015: Mass movement to Europe

**Routes:**
- Eastern Mediterranean (Turkey → Greek islands)
- Balkans (Greece → Macedonia → Serbia → Hungary → Austria → Germany)
- Central Mediterranean (Libya → Italy, dangerous sea crossing)

**Numbers:**
- 2015: ~1+ million arrivals (Europe)
- 2016: ~400,000
- Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis, others

**German Response:**
- Merkel: "Wir schaffen das" ("We can do this")
- Open borders (temporarily, August-September 2015)
- ~1 million asylum seekers (Germany, 2015-2016)

**Backlash:**
- Border controls reintroduced (Schengen suspended, some countries)
- Hungary: Fence (border wall, Serbia/Croatia)
- Visegrad countries (Poland, Czech, Slovakia, Hungary): Refused quotas
- EU-Turkey deal (2016): Turkey stops crossings, EU pays

**Outcomes:**
- Integration challenges (language, housing, employment)
- Far-right surge (AfD Germany, others)
- Polarization (pro vs. anti)

---

## Anthropology of Migration

### Studying Movement

**Transnationalism:**
- Migrants maintain ties (home and host countries)
- Remittances (money sent home)
- Social fields span borders
- Nina Glick Schiller et al. (pioneered concept, 1990s)

**Steven Vertovec:**
- *Super-diversity* (2007, article; 2010, book)
  - Britain (especially London)
  - Beyond simple diversity (multiple origins, legal statuses, languages, religions, networks)
  - New diversification of diversity

**Aihwa Ong:**
- *Flexible Citizenship* (1999)
  - Chinese diaspora
  - Strategic accumulation of passports, residences
  - Transnational capitalist class

**Arjun Appadurai:**
- *Modernity at Large* (1996)
  - Global cultural flows (ethnoscapes, mediascapes, etc.)
  - Imagination (key to modern subjectivity)
  - Diaspora, transnationalism

---

## Urban Segregation

### Ethnic Neighborhoods

**Concentration:**
- Immigrants cluster (ethnic neighborhoods)
- Chain migration (networks bring more)
- Discrimination (housing market, landlords)
- Preference (community, language, services)

**"Ghettos" Debate:**
- Critics: Segregation prevents integration ("parallel societies")
- Defenders: Community support, resources, agency

**Banlieues (France):**
- Suburban housing projects (*cités*, *grands ensembles*)
- Built 1960s-1970s (modernist towers)
- Immigrant concentration (North African, Sub-Saharan)
- Unemployment high, services poor, police tensions

**2005 Riots (France):**
- Trigger: Two teenagers electrocuted (hiding from police)
- Spread: Nationwide (suburbs, burning cars, buildings)
- Duration: 3 weeks
- Response: State of emergency
- Causes: Discrimination, unemployment, police brutality, marginalization

**Anthropology:**
- **Loïc Wacquant:** *Urban Outcasts* (2008)
  - Comparative (Chicago, Paris banlieues)
  - Advanced marginality (neoliberal urbanism)

---

## Brexit

### UK Leaves EU

**Referendum (June 23, 2016):**
- Result: 51.9% Leave, 48.1% Remain
- Turnout: 72.2%

**Motivations (Leave voters):**
- Immigration (Eastern European, free movement)
- Sovereignty ("Take back control," EU regulations)
- Economic (some felt left behind by globalization)
- Identity (national vs. European)

**Geography:**
- England, Wales: Majority Leave
- Scotland, Northern Ireland: Majority Remain
- London: Remain (cosmopolitan)
- Rural, post-industrial areas: Leave

**Outcomes:**
- Political chaos (2016-2020: multiple PMs, elections, deadlock)
- Brexit (January 31, 2020: UK formally left)
- Transition (2020, then fully separate 2021)
- Trade barriers, immigration controls
- Scotland independence debates (renewed)

**Anthropology:**
- **Madeline Reeves:** Borders, migration (Central Asia, but Brexit relevant)
- Ethnographies of Brexit voters, campaigners (emerging)

## Roma in Europe

### Continued Marginalization

**See also:** Europe anthropology file (Roma section)

**Contemporary Issues:**
- Segregated schools (Czech Republic, Hungary, others)
  - Roma children overrepresented in "special schools" (for disabled)
  - Human rights violations (ECHR ruled against Czech Republic)
- Forced sterilizations (Slovakia, Czech Republic, historical, into 1990s-2000s)
- Evictions (Roma settlements, France, Italy, others)
- Attacks (pogroms, violence, Bulgaria, Hungary, others)

**Migration:**
- EU membership (Romania, Bulgaria 2007)
- Roma migrated West (seeking opportunities)
- Faced discrimination there too (France evicted camps)

---

## Climate and Environment

### European Responses

**Paris Agreement (2015):**
- UN climate conference (COP21)
- Agreement: Limit warming <2°C (ideally 1.5°C)
- EU = leader (historically, commitments)

**EU Policies:**
- Emissions trading (cap-and-trade)
- Renewable energy targets
- Green Deal (2019+, net zero by 2050)

**Protests:**
- Fridays for Future (Greta Thunberg, 2018+)
- Youth climate strikes (global, but strong in Europe)
- Extinction Rebellion (civil disobedience)

**Tensions:**
- Economic costs (coal-dependent regions, Poland, Germany)
- Yellow Vests (France, 2018-2019)
  - Fuel tax protests (sparked by carbon tax)
  - Broadened to inequality, cost of living

**Anthropology:**
- Limited specifically European climate anthropology
- But: Energy transitions, environmental justice (relevant)

## COVID-19 Pandemic

### European Experience

**Impact (2020-2022):**
- Italy: First major European outbreak (February-March 2020, Lombardy)
- Lockdowns (strict, most countries, spring 2020)
- Deaths: ~2+ million (Europe, estimates)
- Economic: Recession (2020), recovery uneven

**Responses:**
- EU coordination (some, procurement vaccines)
- National differences (Sweden: no lockdown; others: strict)
- Anti-lockdown protests (some countries)

**Inequalities:**
- Migrants, minorities, poor: Higher infection, death rates
- Essential workers (exposed, often minority/immigrant)
- Remote work: Privilege (class divide)

**Anthropology:**
- Emerging research (lockdown experiences, inequalities, care work, vaccine hesitancy)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Has multiculturalism failed in Europe?

**Question 2:** Why did Brexit happen?

**Question 3:** How should Europe respond to refugees?

**Question 4:** Is Islamophobia racism or legitimate criticism of religion?

**Question 5:** Can Roma ever achieve equality in Europe?
