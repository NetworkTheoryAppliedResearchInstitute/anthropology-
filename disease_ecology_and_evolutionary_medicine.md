## Disease Ecology

### Pathogens and Environments

**Definition:**
- Study of disease in ecological context
- Host-pathogen-environment interactions
- Distribution patterns
- Evolution of disease

**Key Concepts:**
- Diseases aren't random
- Environmental determinants
- Social determinants
- Evolutionary dynamics

---

## Infectious Disease Evolution

### Pathogen Perspectives

**Transmission Modes:**
- Direct contact
- Airborne
- Waterborne
- Vector-borne (mosquitoes, ticks)
- Zoonotic (animal → human)

**Virulence:**
- How harmful?
- Trade-off: kill host too fast → can't transmit
- Optimal virulence (pathogen perspective)

**Paul Ewald:**
- Virulence evolution theory
- Sit-and-wait pathogens (waterborne) → more virulent
- Cholera (water contamination)
- Direct transmission → less virulent (need mobile host)

---

## Zoonotic Diseases

### From Animals to Humans

**Most Emerging Diseases:**
- Zoonotic origin
- 75% of emerging infectious diseases

**Domestication:**
- Living with animals
- Diseases jumped species
- Measles (cattle rinderpest)
- Smallpox (cattle?)
- Influenza (pigs, birds)

**Wildlife:**
- Ebola (fruit bats)
- HIV (chimpanzees → humans, early 20th C)
- SARS, MERS, COVID-19 (bats, via intermediates)
- Plague (rodents, fleas)

**Deforestation:**
- Human-wildlife contact increases
- Habitat destruction
- Disease emergence

**Jared Diamond:**
- "Guns, Germs, and Steel"
- Eurasian domestication → disease resistance
- Decimated Indigenous Americans (smallpox, etc.)

## Epidemiological Transitions

### Disease Patterns Over Time

**Transition 1: Neolithic (Agriculture):**
- Sedentism
- Crowding
- Infectious disease increases
- Zoonoses (domestic animals)
- Water contamination
- Waste accumulation

**Transition 2: Industrial (19th C):**
- Urbanization
- Factories, slums
- Pollution
- Eventually: sanitation, vaccines
- Infectious disease declines (developed world)

**Transition 3: Modern:**
- Chronic diseases dominant (developed)
- Heart disease, cancer, diabetes
- Lifestyle
- Aging populations

**Transition 4? (Emerging):**
- Re-emerging infectious diseases
- Antibiotic resistance
- Climate change
- Globalization

**George Armelagos & Kristin Harper:**
- Elaborated transitions
- Health consequences of cultural change

## Hygiene Hypothesis

### Too Clean?

**Observation:**
- Allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases increasing
- Developed countries
- Rare in developing

**Hypothesis (David Strachan, 1989):**
- Early childhood exposure to microbes → immune regulation
- Modern hygiene → lack exposure
- Immune system attacks harmless (allergies) or self (autoimmune)

**Mechanisms:**
- Th1 vs. Th2 balance (immune pathways)
- Regulatory T cells
- Microbiome

**Evidence:**
- Farm children: fewer allergies
- Siblings: protective
- Deworming → allergies increase

**Critique:**
- Oversimplified
- Which microbes matter?
- Parasites? Bacteria? Viruses?

**"Old Friends" Hypothesis:**
- Graham Rook
- Specific microbes (co-evolved)
- Helminths (worms), soil bacteria
- Not "dirt" generally

---

## Microbiome

### Our Bacterial Selves

**Human Microbiome:**
- Trillions of bacteria (outnumber human cells)
- Gut especially
- Skin, mouth, everywhere

**Functions:**
- Digestion (break down fiber)
- Vitamins (synthesize)
- Immune training
- Pathogen resistance

**Variation:**
- Diet affects
- Antibiotics deplete
- Western vs. non-Western

**Hadza (Hunter-Gatherers):**
- High microbiome diversity
- Seasonal variation
- Fiber-rich diet
- Contrast: Western (low diversity)

**Health Implications:**
- Obesity linked to microbiome
- Autism? (debated)
- Mental health? (gut-brain axis)
- Fecal transplants (C. difficile treatment)

## Evolutionary Medicine

### Why We Get Sick

**Randolph Nesse & George Williams:**
- "Why We Get Sick" (1994)
- Darwinian medicine
- Evolution explains vulnerability

**Key Principles:**

### 1. Defenses Are Not Defects

**Fever:**
- Feels bad
- But: adaptive (inhibits pathogens, boosts immune)
- Reduce fever → slower recovery

**Cough:**
- Annoying
- But: clears airways

**Diarrhea:**
- Expels pathogens
- Stop too soon → prolongs infection

**Pain:**
- Signals damage
- Protective

**Vomiting, Nausea (Pregnancy):**
- "Morning sickness"
- Protects fetus (avoid toxins)
- Margie Profet hypothesis

**Lesson:**
- Symptoms often adaptive
- Suppress cautiously

### 2. Evolutionary Mismatch

**Modern Environment ≠ Ancestral:**

**Diet:**
- Evolved for scarcity
- Modern abundance → obesity, diabetes

**Activity:**
- Evolved for movement
- Modern sedentary → disease

**Sleep:**
- Evolved for natural light
- Modern: screens, artificial light → insomnia

**Hygiene:**
- Evolved with microbes
- Modern sterility → allergies

**Childbirth:**
- Evolved for smaller heads? Or just difficult?
- "Obstetrical dilemma" (debated)

### 3. Pathogens Evolve Faster

**Antibiotic Resistance:**
- Bacteria evolve rapidly
- Overuse antibiotics → resistance
- Arms race

**HIV, Influenza:**
- Mutate quickly
- Evade immune system, vaccines

**Cancer:**
- Somatic evolution
- Cells evolve within body
- Evade treatment

### 4. Trade-Offs

**Sickle Cell:**
- One gene: malaria resistance
- Two genes: sickle cell disease
- Balanced polymorphism
- Trade-off

**Inflammation:**
- Immune response (good)
- Chronic inflammation (bad)
- Heart disease, arthritis

**Reproduction vs. Longevity:**
- Energy trade-off
- Early reproduction → shorter life?

### 5. Constraints and Legacies

**Vestigial:**
- Appendix (reduced)
- Coccyx (tail remnant)
- Wisdom teeth (don't fit)

**Back Pain:**
- Bipedalism recent
- Spine adapted for quadrupedalism
- Vertebral problems

**Choking:**
- Larynx position (speech)
- But: food/air crossover (dangerous)

**Birth Canal:**
- Large head vs. narrow pelvis
- Obstetrical dilemma

### 6. Selection Acts on Reproduction

**Not Health, Longevity:**
- Fitness = reproductive success
- After reproduction: selection weak

**Menopause:**
- Reproduction stops (mid-life)
- Longevity continues
- Grandmother hypothesis (help grandchildren)

**Aging:**
- Post-reproductive
- Selection doesn't fix (antagonistic pleiotropy, mutation accumulation)

---

## One Health

### Interconnected Health

**Concept:**
- Human, animal, environmental health linked
- Holistic approach
- Zoonoses
- Antibiotic resistance (agriculture)
- Climate change

**COVID-19 Example:**
- Zoonotic (likely bats → humans)
- Deforestation, wildlife trade
- Global spread
- Environmental degradation → pandemic risk

---

## Climate Change and Health

### Emerging Threat

**Direct:**
- Heat waves (mortality)
- Extreme weather
- Air pollution

**Indirect:**
- Vector-borne disease (expand ranges)
  - Malaria (higher altitudes, latitudes)
  - Dengue, Zika
- Food insecurity (crop failures)
- Water scarcity
- Migration, conflict

**Vulnerable:**
- Global South
- Indigenous peoples
- Poor

---

## Antibiotic Resistance

### Crisis

**Overuse:**
- Human medicine (unnecessary prescriptions)
- Agriculture (growth promotion, prophylaxis)

**Selection:**
- Resistant strains survive
- Spread

**Consequences:**
- "Superbugs"
- MRSA, CRE
- Untreatable infections
- Post-antibiotic era?

**Solutions:**
- Stewardship (reduce use)
- New antibiotics (few developed)
- Vaccines (prevent need)
- Phage therapy?

---

## Mental Health Evolution

### Depression, Anxiety

**Mismatch:**
- Modern stress
- Social isolation
- Lack meaning

**Adaptive?**
- Some argue depression adaptive (conservation mode)
- Social navigation hypothesis (negotiate status)
- Controversial

**Prevalence:**
- Increasing (or diagnosis increasing?)
- Developed countries

**Treatments:**
- Medication (SSRIs)
- Therapy
- Lifestyle (exercise, nature, connection)

---

## Dental Evolution

### Malocclusion

**Problem:**
- Crooked teeth
- Wisdom teeth impacted
- Overbite, underbite

**Causes:**
- Soft diet (modern)
- Jaws don't develop fully
- Teeth crowded

**Evolution:**
- Teeth size decreased (agriculture)
- But: jaw size decreased more
- Mismatch

**Orthodontics:**
- Modern intervention
- But: preventable? (harder foods in childhood)

---

## Pregnancy and Birth

### Obstetrical Dilemma

**Problem:**
- Human birth difficult, dangerous
- Large head (brain)
- Narrow pelvis (bipedalism)

**Trade-Off:**
- Brain size vs. birth canal
- Premature birth (compared to other primates)

**Critique:**
- Recently questioned
- Pelvis size not as constrained?
- Metabolic limits instead?
- Debated

**C-Sections:**
- Increasing rates
- Necessary (some)
- Overused? (some)
- Evolution: if C-sections universal, selection relaxed

---

## Lactose Tolerance

### Gene-Culture Coevolution

**Most Mammals:**
- Lactase persistence rare

**Humans:**
- Some populations (Northern Europe, East African pastoralists)
- Gene-culture coevolution
- Dairy farming → selection

**Recent:**
- ~10,000 years
- Strong selection
- Multiple mutations (convergent)

**Mismatch:**
- Lactose intolerant individuals drink milk
- Digestive distress

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Should we always suppress fever, or let it run?

**Question 2:** Is modern hygiene causing allergies?

**Question 3:** Can we "evolve" our way out of modern diseases?

**Question 4:** Is aging a disease or natural?

**Question 5:** Should evolutionary medicine change medical practice?

**Remember:** Disease ecology studies pathogens in environmental/social context. Infectious disease evolution: virulence trade-offs (Ewald), sit-and-wait waterborne more virulent. Zoonotic diseases 75% emerging (domestication measles/smallpox from cattle, HIV from chimps, COVID-19 likely bats). Epidemiological transitions: agriculture→infectious disease increase, industrial→chronic diseases. Hygiene hypothesis (Strachan 1989): too clean→allergies/asthma/autoimmune, "old friends" need microbe exposure. Microbiome trillions bacteria, gut diversity (Hadza high vs. Western low), functions digestion/immunity/pathogen resistance. Evolutionary medicine (Nesse & Williams 1994 "Why We Get Sick"): (1) Defenses not defects (fever/cough/diarrhea/pain adaptive), (2) Mismatch (modern environment≠ancestral, diet/activity/sleep/hygiene), (3) Pathogens evolve faster (antibiotic resistance), (4) Trade-offs (sickle cell), (5) Constraints/legacies (back pain bipedalism, choking speech), (6) Selection on reproduction not longevity (menopause, aging). One Health interconnected (COVID-19 zoonotic deforestation). Climate change health threats (vector-borne disease expanding). Antibiotic resistance crisis (overuse agriculture/medicine). Mental health mismatch (isolation, stress). Dental malocclusion soft diet. Obstetrical dilemma debated. Lactose tolerance gene-culture coevolution recent strong selection. Understanding evolutionary medicine reveals why we get sick—not design flaws but evolutionary compromises, mismatches, trade-offs—changes medical practice perspective.
