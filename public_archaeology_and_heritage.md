---

## Heritage Management

### Protecting the Past

**Why?**
- Finite resource (sites destroyed = gone forever)
- Cultural identity
- Education
- Tourism

**Legal Frameworks:**

### United States

**National Historic Preservation Act (1966):**
- **Section 106:**
  - Federal projects → survey
  - Identify sites
  - Mitigate impacts

**NAGPRA (1990):**
- Native American remains, objects

**Antiquities Act (1906):**
- Protects federal lands
- Permits required

**State Laws:**
- Vary (some strong, some weak)

### UNESCO World Heritage

**Designation:**
- "Outstanding universal value"
- 1,100+ sites (worldwide)
- Prestige
- Protection (ideally)

**Examples:**
- Great Wall (China)
- Taj Mahal (India)
- Grand Canyon (US)

**Problems:**
- Conflicts (development vs. preservation)
- War (destruction: Palmyra, Syria)
- Climate change (Venice flooding)

---

## CRM: Cultural Resource Management

### The Business of Archaeology

**Definition:**
- Compliance archaeology
- Required by law (US: Section 106)
- Private firms, government agencies

**Process:**
1. **Phase I (Survey):**
   - Walk land, look for sites
   - Shovel test pits
   - Identify resources

2. **Phase II (Evaluation):**
   - Test excavations
   - Assess significance (NRHP criteria)

3. **Phase III (Mitigation):**
   - If significant, can't avoid
   - Excavate, document (data recovery)
   - Preserve by record

**Employment:**
- Most archaeologists (US)
- Majority of fieldwork

**Critique:**
- "Contract archaeology" (client pays)
- Pressure (fast, cheap)
- Gray literature (reports unpublished)
- Triage (can't save everything)

---

## Looting and Site Destruction

### Threats to Sites

### Looting (Pothunting)

**Illegal Excavation:**
- Artifacts sold (black market)
- Provenance lost (context destroyed)
- Scientific value gone

**Scale:**
- Worldwide problem
- Syria, Iraq (war, chaos)
- Southwest US (private land, weak laws)

**Example: Antiquities Trafficking**
- ISIS (Palmyra, others)
- Funding

**Combat:**
- Laws (stronger)
- Enforcement
- Education (ethics)
- Reduce demand (collectors)

### Development

**Construction:**
- Roads, buildings, dams
- Sites destroyed

**CRM Helps:**
- But: not all land surveyed
- Private land (no protection, US)

### Climate Change

**Rising Seas:**
- Coastal sites threatened
- Erosion
- Examples: East Coast US, Pacific Islands

**Permafrost Melting:**
- Arctic sites exposed
- Organic preservation lost

**Drought, Flooding:**
- Damage

**Response:**
- Triage (prioritize)
- Digital documentation
- Rapid excavation

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Should all archaeological sites be open to tourists?

**Question 2:** Is CRM "saving" sites or just documenting destruction?

**Question 3:** Can technology replace excavation?

**Question 4:** Should ancient DNA be studied without community consent?

**Question 5:** Does public archaeology dumb down science?
