# Ethical Dilemmas: Complex Scenarios and Navigation

---

## Why Scenarios Matter

Ethical principles (do no harm, informed consent, confidentiality) provide guidance. But real fieldwork presents **complex situations where principles conflict, where "right" answer isn't obvious, where anthropologists must navigate competing responsibilities.**

These scenarios illustrate:
- The messiness of real ethics
- How principles can conflict
- The need for contextual judgment
- That reasonable people may disagree
- Why ethics requires ongoing reflection

**No scenario has one "correct" answer.** The goal is to think through competing considerations carefully.

## Scenario 1: The Illegal Border Crossing

### The Situation

You're studying undocumented migration across the US-Mexico border. You've built relationships with migrants and smugglers.

One night, you're invited to observe a border crossing. If you go:
- **Invaluable data:** Understand process firsthand, embodied knowledge
- **Risk to you:** Could be arrested for aiding illegal activity
- **Risk to them:** Your presence might increase danger
- **Ethical complexity:** Observing but not intervening if danger arises

### Competing Considerations

**For Going:**
- Core anthropological method (participant observation)
- Can't understand without experiencing
- Shows commitment to community
- Data would enrich research enormously

**Against Going:**
- Legal risk (arrest, prosecution)
- Physical risk (dangerous conditions)
- Could endanger migrants (additional person, potential complications)
- Observer effect (changes dynamics)
- If something goes wrong, you bear responsibility

**Informed Consent:**
- Did migrants consent to your presence?
- Do they understand risks you introduce?
- Can they freely say no?

### Questions to Consider

**1. Who benefits?**
Primarily you (data for career). Migrants bear all risk.

**2. Observer vs. Participant:**
If someone is injured, do you help (blow cover, endanger everyone) or observe (violate do no harm)?

**3. Legal vs. Ethical:**
Legal risk to you vs. ethical obligation to understand. Which matters more?

**4. Would You Intervene?**
If Border Patrol approaches, what do you do?

### Possible Approaches

**Don't Go:**
- Too risky for everyone
- Rely on interviews, post-crossing observations
- Accept limits of knowledge

**Go With Precautions:**
- Clear agreement with migrants
- Plan for emergencies
- Accept legal consequences
- Prepare to stop observing if necessary

**Consult:**
- Community about whether appropriate
- Lawyers about legal risks
- IRB (likely would reject)

### No Easy Answer

This scenario illustrates: **Most valuable data often most ethically fraught.**

## Scenario 2: The Witness to Abuse

### The Situation

During fieldwork with a family, you witness a parent hitting a child hard enough to leave marks.

**Context:**
- Corporal punishment is culturally normative
- Most community members see this as acceptable discipline
- But child has visible injury

### The Dilemma

**Cultural Relativism:**
- Should respect cultural practices
- Not impose your values
- "Abuse" is culturally defined

**Universal Rights:**
- Child is being harmed physically
- International child rights conventions prohibit this
- Do no harm principle

**Legal:**
- In US, mandated reporter (must report suspected abuse)
- But you're studying another culture, different norms

**Practical:**
- Reporting could:
  - Protect this child
  - Destroy research relationships
  - Harm family (child welfare intervention)
  - Get you expelled from community
  - Put other children at risk (lose research access)

### Questions to Consider

**1. Who Defines Harm?**
- Western standards vs. local standards
- Parents say discipline, you say abuse—who's right?

**2. Whose Perspective Matters Most?**
- Child's experience of pain?
- Parents' cultural norms?
- Community consensus?
- International law?

**3. Consequences:**
- Will reporting actually help this child?
- Could it make things worse?
- What about long-term research goals?

**4. Consistency:**
- If you intervene here, must you intervene in all cases?
- Where's the line?

### Possible Approaches

**Don't Intervene:**
- Respect cultural autonomy
- Not your role to impose values
- Focus on understanding, not judging

**But:** Can you ethically witness harm and do nothing?

**Intervene:**
- Report to authorities
- Confront parents
- Remove yourself from situation

**But:** Could cause more harm, destroy research, impose values.

**Middle Ground:**
- Discuss child welfare with community members
- Support local efforts to address violence
- Provide information on alternatives
- Not judge but educate

**But:** Is this also imposing values?

**Seek Guidance:**
- Community elders, child welfare experts within culture
- Understand local perspectives on acceptable discipline
- Voices of children themselves

### No Easy Answer

This illustrates: **Cultural relativism has limits, but where? Reasonable anthropologists disagree.**

## Scenario 3: The Subpoenaed Field Notes

### The Situation

You studied urban gang members. One informant is now on trial for murder. Prosecutor subpoenas your field notes, claiming they contain evidence.

**Your notes do contain:**
- Informant's statements about violence
- Observations of activities
- Information that could incriminate

### The Dilemma

**Confidentiality:**
- Promised to protect informants
- Professional ethics say maintain confidentiality
- Betraying trust violates core principle

**Legal Obligation:**
- Court orders you to provide notes
- Refusal = contempt of court (jail time)
- Not legally privileged like lawyer-client

**Harm:**
- Providing notes could convict informant (you as state's witness)
- Could endanger other gang members (retaliation)
- Destroys your reputation in community
- Future research impossible

**Justice:**
- If informant committed murder, shouldn't justice be served?
- Victim's family deserves truth?

### Questions to Consider

**1. Researcher-Participant Privilege:**
Should anthropologists have legal protection like journalists' shield laws?

**2. Informed Consent:**
Did you warn informants notes could be subpoenaed?

**3. Whose Rights:**
Informant's right to confidentiality vs. state's interest in prosecution vs. victim's right to justice?

**4. Discipline's Reputation:**
If anthropologists can't promise confidentiality, who will trust us?

### What Anthropologists Have Done

**Rik Scarce (sociologist):**
- Studied environmental activists
- Subpoenaed after arson case
- Refused to testify
- Jailed for contempt (159 days)
- Released without testifying

**Mario Brajuha:**
- Restaurant worker ethnography
- Suspected arson at restaurant
- Fought subpoena for years
- Eventually fire ruled accidental, case dropped

**Lessons:**
- Legal risk is real
- Protecting confidentiality has costs
- Courts don't always respect research ethics

### Possible Approaches

**Fight Subpoena:**
- Hire lawyer
- Argue research privilege
- Public pressure
- Accept jail if necessary

**Comply:**
- Provide notes
- Protect other informants where possible
- Accept research relationships over

**Negotiate:**
- Limited testimony
- Redacted notes
- Informal cooperation

**Prevent:**
- Don't keep identifiable notes
- Destroy after analysis
- Code names, encryption

### No Easy Answer

This illustrates: **Professional ethics may conflict with legal obligations. Be prepared to suffer consequences.**

## Scenario 4: The Romantic Relationship

### The Situation

During fieldwork, you develop romantic feelings for an informant, who reciprocates. You're both adults, both interested.

### The Dilemma

**Power Imbalance:**
- You're researcher, they're subject
- You control representation
- You have institutional power
- Similar to teacher-student (problematic)

**Consent:**
- Can they freely consent given power dynamic?
- Could they feel pressured (you control research access)?
- Even if genuine attraction, is power difference too great?

**Professional Ethics:**
- Exploiting research relationships?
- Using position for personal gain?
- Betraying professional boundaries?

**Human:**
- People develop feelings
- Denying humanity of both parties?
- Love happens—can't always control

**Research Impact:**
- How does relationship change research?
- Objectivity compromised? (Was it ever possible?)
- Other informants' reactions?
- If relationship ends badly, can you continue research?

### Questions to Consider

**1. Timing:**
- During fieldwork = problematic
- After fieldwork = more acceptable?
- How long after?

**2. True Mutuality:**
- Can there be equal relationship given power difference?
- What if you met outside research—would attraction still exist?

**3. Transparency:**
- Disclose to IRB, supervisor?
- Acknowledge in publication?

**4. Community:**
- Local norms about relationships?
- How will community perceive?

### What Ethics Say

**Professional Codes:**
- Generally discourage sexual relationships with informants
- Similar to therapeutic boundaries

**But:**
- Not absolute prohibition
- Context matters
- Long-term relationships different from brief affairs

### Possible Approaches

**Don't Pursue:**
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Wait until after fieldwork
- Accept limitation

**Pursue After Fieldwork:**
- End research first
- Return later as person, not researcher
- Disclose in publications

**Pursue Carefully:**
- Full transparency
- Reflexivity about power
- Impact on research acknowledged
- If relationship fails, leave field

**Many Say:**
During active fieldwork, power imbalance too great. Feelings may be real but acting on them unethical.

### No Easy Answer

This illustrates: **Anthropologists are human. But professional ethics exist for good reasons—power matters.**

## Scenario 5: The Harmful Tradition

### The Situation

You're studying a community that practices female genital cutting (FGC). Women in the community defend the practice:
- It's tradition
- Makes women marriageable
- Community identity
- Women choose it for daughters

But you know:
- Health risks (infection, pain, complications)
- International human rights conventions condemn it
- Some women oppose it but can't speak publicly

### The Dilemma

**Cultural Relativism:**
- Community's right to their traditions
- Women's stated support
- Outsider condemnation = cultural imperialism

**Human Rights:**
- Bodily integrity
- Health risks
- Girls can't consent (done to children)
- Some women dissent (silenced voices)

**Research Role:**
- Anthropologist as neutral observer?
- Or advocate for change?
- Who decides what's harmful?

**Complexity:**
- Women both victims and agents
- They perpetuate practice they may have resented
- Complex power dynamics (gender, generation, community)

### Questions to Consider

**1. Who Speaks for Women?**
- Majority defend practice
- Minority oppose but silent
- Girls themselves (no voice)
- Which voices count?

**2. Change From Within:**
- Support local women organizing against it?
- That's not neutrality—that's picking sides

**3. Your Platform:**
- Publishing research could support anti-FGC campaigns
- Is that betraying community confidence?
- Or ethical use of platform?

**4. Paternalism:**
- Are you "saving" women who don't want saving?
- Imposing Western values?

### Anthropologists' Positions

**Some Say:**
- FGC is harmful, period
- Human rights trump cultural rights
- Support abolition efforts

**Others Say:**
- Western anti-FGC campaigns often racist, colonialist
- Focus on "savage" practices elsewhere
- Ignore genital cosmetic surgery in West
- Support women's agency to make own decisions

**Middle Ground:**
- Support local women's organizing
- Provide information on health risks
- Oppose coercion
- But respect community processes
- Don't impose Western solutions

### Possible Approaches

**Neutral Documentation:**
- Study without advocating
- Present multiple perspectives
- Let readers judge

**But:** Is neutrality actually taking a side (supporting status quo)?

**Active Opposition:**
- Support anti-FGC organizations
- Publish critiquing practice
- Advocate for ban

**But:** Cultural imperialism? Undermining women's stated choices?

**Support Local Change:**
- Work with women in community who oppose
- Amplify their voices
- Provide resources for their organizing
- But not impose outside agenda

### No Easy Answer

This illustrates: **Most difficult dilemmas involve cultural practices that harm—universal rights vs. cultural autonomy. No consensus among anthropologists.**

## Scenario 6: The Corporate Sponsor

### The Situation

You receive generous funding from a corporation to study consumer behavior. The research seems straightforward, but:

**The corporation:**
- Will use findings for marketing
- Could manipulate consumers
- Has history of labor violations
- Environmental problems

**The funding:**
- Lets you do research (no other funding available)
- Supports your students
- Advances your career

**The research:**
- Scientifically valid
- Interesting questions
- But serves corporate profit

### The Dilemma

**Professional Independence:**
- Can you maintain objectivity with corporate funder?
- Publication freedom?
- Control over data?

**Ethical Use:**
- Even if research is ethical, will use be ethical?
- Helping corporation exploit consumers?

**Complicity:**
- Taking money from company with questionable practices
- Does this make you complicit?

**Pragmatism:**
- Need funding to do research
- If you don't do it, someone else will
- Can advocate for change from inside?

### Questions to Consider

**1. Conditions:**
- Do you control publication?
- Intellectual property rights?
- Freedom to publish findings company dislikes?

**2. Transparency:**
- Disclose funding source?
- Potential conflicts of interest?

**3. Harm:**
- Who could be harmed by this research?
- Is helping company increase sales harmful?

**4. Alternatives:**
- Other funding sources?
- Worth compromising for this opportunity?

### Possible Approaches

**Accept With Conditions:**
- Negotiate full publication rights
- Disclose funding source
- Maintain independence
- Hope for best

**Decline:**
- Too ethically problematic
- Find other funding
- Accept career consequences

**Accept and Critique:**
- Take money, do research
- But also critique corporate practices
- Use platform to advocate

**Boycott:**
- Refuse any corporate funding
- Academic purity
- But limits research opportunities

### No Easy Answer

This illustrates: **Applied anthropology often involves working with powerful institutions. Can you do so ethically? Where's the line?**

## Common Themes Across Scenarios

### 1. Competing Principles

Ethics isn't following rules—it's **navigating competing goods:**
- Confidentiality vs. justice
- Cultural relativism vs. human rights
- Research goals vs. individual welfare
- Professional ethics vs. legal obligations

### 2. Power Everywhere

Can't escape power:
- Researcher power over representation
- Institutional power (legal, corporate, governmental)
- Cultural power (whose norms dominate?)
- Community power over individuals

**Must navigate, can't eliminate.**

### 3. No Neutral Position

**Every choice is political:**
- Silence supports status quo
- Speech may impose values
- Inaction has consequences
- Action does too

### 4. Reasonable Disagreement

**Good anthropologists disagree** on these scenarios.

Different values, different priorities, different assessments of risk/harm.

**What matters:**
- Thoughtful engagement
- Transparency
- Accountability
- Willingness to bear consequences

### 5. Context Is Everything

**Abstract principles can't resolve:**
- Specific contexts
- Particular relationships
- Local meanings
- Historical circumstances

**Ethical judgment requires:**
- Deep knowledge
- Cultural understanding
- Relationships
- Humility

## How to Navigate Ethical Dilemmas

### 1. Gather Information

- Understand fully before judging
- Multiple perspectives
- Historical context
- Local meanings

### 2. Identify Stakeholders

- Who is affected?
- What are their interests?
- Who has power?
- Whose voices are missing?

### 3. Name the Values in Conflict

- Confidentiality vs. X?
- Cultural autonomy vs. Y?
- What exactly is the tension?

### 4. Consider Consequences

- Short-term vs. long-term
- Intended vs. unintended
- For individuals vs. community
- For discipline

### 5. Consult

- Community members
- Colleagues
- Ethics committees
- Affected parties

### 6. Be Transparent

- Document decision process
- Explain reasoning
- Acknowledge uncertainty

### 7. Accept Responsibility

- Own your decision
- Bear consequences
- Learn from outcomes

### 8. Revisit

- Ethical judgment isn't one-time
- Circumstances change
- New information emerges
- Reassess continually

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Which scenario troubled you most? Why?

**Question 2:** In Scenario 2 (witnessing abuse), what would you do? Can you defend your choice?

**Question 3:** Should anthropologists ever break confidentiality? Under what circumstances?

**Question 4:** Is cultural relativism ultimately defensible, or are some practices universally wrong?

**Question 5:** How much career sacrifice is ethical conduct worth? Where's your line?

## Essential Readings

- Fluehr-Lobban, Carolyn. (2003). *Ethics and the Profession of Anthropology*
- Bourgois, Philippe. (1990). "Confronting Anthropological Ethics" (crack dealers study)
- Scheper-Hughes, Nancy. (1995). "The Primacy of the Ethical"

**Remember:** Ethical dilemmas don't have neat solutions. Principles conflict. Reasonable people disagree. What matters is engaging thoughtfully, acknowledging competing considerations, being transparent about choices, and accepting responsibility for consequences. Easy situations don't require ethics—hard ones do. These scenarios prepare you for the messy reality of anthropological practice where ethics isn't about following rules but about navigating complexity with care, humility, and commitment to doing less harm.
