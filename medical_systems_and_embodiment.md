# Medical Systems and Illness Experience: Disease, Illness, and Embodiment

---

## Disease vs. Illness: A Foundational Distinction

### Arthur Kleinman's Framework

**Arthur Kleinman (Harvard psychiatrist-anthropologist):**
- Pioneered medical anthropology
- Fundamental distinction

**Three Levels:**

**1. Disease:**
- Biological pathology
- Malfunctioning organs, systems
- Biomedicine's focus
- Measurable, observable
- Doctor's perspective

**2. Illness:**
- Subjective experience
- How person feels, suffers
- Culturally shaped
- Meaning, interpretation
- Patient's perspective

**3. Sickness:**
- Social dimension
- How society responds
- Sick role, legitimacy
- Social consequences

**Example: Diabetes**
- **Disease**: High blood glucose, insulin problems
- **Illness**: Fatigue, thirst, fear, lifestyle changes
- **Sickness**: Medical appointments, disability status, family impact

**Why It Matters:**
- Biomedicine focuses on disease
- Often ignores illness (experience)
- Patients want both addressed
- Culture shapes illness

## Explanatory Models

### Kleinman's "Explanatory Models" (1980)

**What Are Explanatory Models?**
- How people explain illness
- Causes, symptoms, treatments
- Expected outcomes
- Culturally specific

**Five Questions:**
1. What do you call the problem?
2. What do you think caused it?
3. Why did it start when it did?
4. What does the sickness do? How does it work?
5. How severe is it? Will it last long?

**Doctor vs. Patient Models:**
- Often differ
- Miscommunication
- Doctor: biomedical cause
- Patient: social, moral, spiritual cause

**Example: Heart Attack**

**Biomedical Model:**
- Blocked coronary artery
- Cholesterol, genetics
- Treatment: surgery, medication

**Patient's Model (might be):**
- Stress from job
- God's punishment
- Bad luck
- Treatment: prayer, rest, change life

**Effective Care:**
- Understand patient's model
- Negotiate
- Address both disease and illness

## Medical Systems Globally

### Three Sectors (Kleinman)

**1. Popular Sector:**
- Lay people, families
- Self-treatment
- Home remedies
- Most illness handled here
- 70-90% of all episodes

**2. Folk Sector:**
- Non-professional healers
- Herbalists, shamans, midwives
- Traditional practitioners
- Community-based

**3. Professional Sector:**
- Credentialed specialists
- Biomedicine
- Traditional medicine (Ayurveda, TCM if professionalized)
- Institutional

**Medical Pluralism:**
- Multiple systems coexist
- People use all three
- Strategic choices
- Shop around

## Biomedicine as Cultural System

### Not "Scientific" vs. "Cultural"

**Biomedicine IS Culture:**
- Western medicine
- Historical, cultural product
- Not culture-free

**Characteristics:**

**Mind-Body Dualism:**
- Cartesian split
- Body = machine
- Mind separate
- Psychosomatic marginalized

**Reductionism:**
- Break down to smallest parts
- Organs, cells, molecules
- Lose whole person

**Individualism:**
- Patient = individual
- Ignore social context
- Focus on body

**Technological Imperative:**
- Technology = progress
- High-tech preferred
- Low-tech devalued

**Cure over Care:**
- Fix disease
- Cure-oriented
- Chronic illness, dying = failure

**Byron Good:**
- "Medicine, Rationality, and Experience"
- Biomedicine constructs illness
- Not just discovers

## Embodiment and Phenomenology

### Beyond Mind-Body Dualism

**Thomas Csordas:**
- "Embodiment as Paradigm"
- Body not just object
- Body = subject, lived experience
- Pre-objective experience

**Phenomenology:**
- Merleau-Ponty (philosopher)
- Body = being-in-world
- Perception embodied
- Not mind controlling body

**Medical Anthropology:**
- Study lived illness

### Chronic Pain

**Pain = Cultural:**
- How expressed
- Meanings
- Tolerance

**Mark Zborowski (1950s):**
- "Old Americans" stoic
- Jewish, Italian expressive
- Pain behavior cultural

**Critique:**
- Stereotypes
- Overgeneralized
- But: insight that pain cultural

**Chronic Pain:**
- No biomedical "cause" found
- Dismissed as "not real"
- But: suffering real
- Embodied distress

**Arthur Kleinman, "The Illness Narratives":**
- Chronic pain patients
- Meanings of pain
- Life disrupted
- Need to be heard

### Cancer

## Placebo and Meaning

### Power of Meaning

**Placebo Effect:**
- Improvement from "inert" treatment
- Belief, expectation
- Mind-body connection
- Real physiological changes

**Daniel Moerman:**
- "Meaning Response"
- Not just placebo (negative)
- Meaning heals
- Ritual, symbols matter

**Irving Kirsch:**
- Antidepressants
- Much of effect = placebo
- Expectation powerful

**Medical Anthropology:**
- All healing partly symbolic
- Biomedicine too (white coat, stethoscope, ritual)
- Meanings matter

---

## Critical Medical Anthropology

### Power and Inequality

**Hans Baer, Merrill Singer, Ida Susser:**
- Health = political, economic
- Inequality makes sick
- Capitalism, racism, poverty

**Focus:**
- Social determinants of health
- Who gets sick, why
- Access to care
- Pharmaceutical industry
- Commodification

**Not Just Culture:**
- Material conditions
- Power structures
- Political economy

---

## Iatrogenesis

### Medicine's Harms

**Ivan Illich:**
- "Medical Nemesis" (1975)
- Iatrogenesis = physician-caused illness

**Three Types:**

**Clinical:**
- Medical errors
- Side effects
- Infections (hospitals)

**Social:**
- Medicalization of life
- Childbirth, death, sadness → medical
- Dependency on experts

**Cultural:**
- Loss of ability to cope
- Suffering becomes medical problem
- Robbed of meaning

**Anthropology:**
- Documents overmedicalization
- But also: medicine saves lives
- Balance

---

## Medicalization

### Expanding Medical Jurisdiction

**Peter Conrad:**
- "Medicalization of Society"
- Normal life processes → medical

**Examples:**
- Childbirth (once home → hospital)
- Menopause (now "hormone deficiency")
- Shyness → "social anxiety disorder"
- Grief → "major depressive disorder"
- ADHD (childhood behavior → disorder)

**Drivers:**
- Pharmaceutical industry
- Professions expanding
- Biomedicine hegemonic
- Individualize social problems

**Consequences:**
- Medical control
- Pills for problems
- Ignore social causes

**But Also:**
- Access to treatment
- Legitimacy (sick role)
- Insurance coverage

**Complex:**
- Not simply good or bad

---

## Pharmaceuticalization

### Anthropology of Pharmaceuticals

**João Biehl:**
- Brazil, AIDS medications
- Pharmaceuticalization of public health
- Access struggles
- "Will to Live"

**Andrew Lakoff:**
- "Pharmaceutical Reason"
- Clinical trials, global
- Regulation, markets

**Adriana Petryna:**
- "When Experiments Travel"
- Clinical trials outsourced
- Ethical issues
- Global inequality

**Joseph Dumit:**
- "Drugs for Life"
- Chronic medications
- Lifelong treatment
- Asymptomatic conditions
- Preventive medications
- Expand markets

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is biomedicine "better" than traditional medicine, or just different?

**Question 2:** Can illness experience be separated from cultural meaning?

**Question 3:** Is medicalization always harmful, or sometimes helpful?

**Question 4:** Do placebos "work," or is healing "real" only if biomedical?

**Question 5:** What explanatory model do you use when sick?

**Remember:** Disease (biological) ≠ illness (experience). Kleinman's explanatory models show doctor-patient gaps. Medical pluralism exists globally—people use popular, folk, professional sectors. Biomedicine is cultural system, not culture-free (dualism, reductionism, individualism, technology). Traditional medicines (TCM, Ayurveda, curanderismo) offer holistic alternatives. Embodiment approach (Csordas) studies lived experience. Healing rituals work through meaning (symbolic healing). Placebo shows meaning matters. Critical medical anthropology examines power, inequality. Medicalization expands medical control. Pharmaceuticalization transforms health. Understanding medical anthropology reveals how culture shapes health, illness, healing—and how medicine is always cultural practice, not just biology.
