# Cultural Relativism: Understanding Before Judging

---

## The Challenge

Imagine you're conducting research in a society where:
- Parents arrange marriages for their 14-year-old children
- Women undergo a painful ritual modification of their genitals
- Accused thieves have their hands amputated
- Or... people spend thousands of dollars on cosmetic surgery to look younger, confine elderly parents to institutional care, and allow children as young as 6 to compete in beauty pageants

Which of these should you condemn? Which should you try to understand? And who gets to decide?

These questions sit at the heart of one of anthropology's most important—and most controversial—concepts: cultural relativism.

## What Cultural Relativism IS (and Isn't)

### The Core Idea: Methodological Relativism

**Cultural relativism**, in its fundamental anthropological sense, is a **methodological principle**:

**To understand a cultural practice, belief, or value, you must examine it within its own cultural context rather than judging it by the standards of your own culture.**

This means:
- Suspending your immediate reactions of approval or disapproval
- Asking what this practice means to the people who engage in it
- Understanding how it connects to other aspects of their social world
- Recognizing that your own standards are culturally constructed too

> **Example: The Funeral Feast**
>
> When anthropologist Clifford Geertz studied Javanese funeral practices, he observed an elaborate feast following a death. From a Western "rational" perspective focused on efficiency and grief, this might seem wasteful—spending scarce resources on a party while mourning.
>
> But Geertz discovered that the feast wasn't wasteful at all. It was essential for:
> - Reassembling the community after a rupture (death)
> - Redistributing the deceased's social obligations
> - Demonstrating the family's ongoing social standing
> - Performing religious duties that ensured the deceased's peaceful transition
>
> Understanding this required Geertz to temporarily set aside his own cultural assumptions about appropriate mourning and economic rationality.

### What Relativism is NOT: Moral Relativism

**Cultural relativism does NOT mean:**
- "Anything goes"
- All practices are equally good
- We cannot make ethical judgments
- Anthropologists must approve of everything they observe
- There are no human rights or ethical standards

This confusion between **methodological relativism** (suspend judgment to understand) and **moral relativism** (no practice can be judged wrong) has caused endless debate within and beyond anthropology.

## Historical Context: Boas's Anti-Racist Intervention

Cultural relativism emerged as a powerful response to 19th-century scientific racism and cultural evolutionism.

### The Bad Old Days: Victorian Hierarchies

In the late 1800s, European and American scholars ranked cultures on an evolutionary ladder:
- **Savagery** → **Barbarism** → **Civilization**

European culture represented the pinnacle; other societies were seen as primitive stages through which all humanity must pass. This justified colonialism as a civilizing mission and provided pseudo-scientific support for racism.

### Franz Boas: A Revolutionary Alternative

Franz Boas, the "Father of American Anthropology," fought this racism with cultural relativism:

**"Civilization is not something absolute, but... is relative, and... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes."**

Boas's arguments:
1. **No evolutionary hierarchy exists** among cultures—just different adaptations
2. **Each culture must be understood in its own terms**, not ranked against a supposed universal standard
3. **European culture has no claim to superiority**—it simply reflects one set of historical circumstances
4. **What seems "primitive" often reflects sophisticated knowledge** we don't immediately recognize

> **Example: Inuit Knowledge**
>
> Where Europeans saw "primitive" Inuit peoples, Boas documented incredibly sophisticated knowledge systems:
> - Dozens of words for different types of snow and ice (each meaningful for survival)
> - Detailed understanding of animal behavior and seasonal patterns
> - Complex navigational abilities in featureless landscapes
> - Ingenious technologies for extreme cold
>
> This wasn't "primitive"—it was specialized expertise that most Europeans completely lacked.

Boas used cultural relativism as an **anti-racist weapon**, demonstrating that human diversity reflects different solutions to life's challenges, not a hierarchy of superiority.

## Why Relativism Matters: The Ethnocentric Alternative

**Ethnocentrism** is the opposite of cultural relativism: judging other cultures by the standards of your own and assuming your way is the "right" or "natural" way.

### Everyday Ethnocentrism

> **American Individualism:**
>
> Americans often view cultures that emphasize family loyalty over individual choice as "oppressive" or "backwards." An Indian parent arranging their child's marriage might seem to violate the child's autonomy.
>
> But from many Indian perspectives, Americans appear **selfish and irresponsible**—abandoning elderly parents to nursing homes, prioritizing personal happiness over family duty, allowing inexperienced young people to make crucial life decisions based on fleeting romantic feelings.
>
> Both perspectives are ethnocentric. Cultural relativism asks us to understand *why* each system makes sense to those within it.

### Consequences of Ethnocentrism

When powerful groups impose their standards on others, consequences include:
- **Colonial violence:** "Civilizing" missions destroyed indigenous cultures
- **Forced assimilation:** Native American boarding schools attempted to "kill the Indian, save the man"
- **Medical imperialism:** Imposing Western medical models without understanding local healing systems
- **Development disasters:** Aid projects failing because they ignored local knowledge and practices

## The Hard Cases: Where Relativism Gets Difficult

### Female Genital Cutting

Perhaps no practice tests cultural relativism more than female genital cutting (FGC), practiced in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Practices range from symbolic nicking to infibulation (removal of external genitalia and sewing shut).

**The Absolutist Position:**
- FGC violates girls' bodily integrity and human rights
- It causes pain, health complications, sometimes death
- It's a form of patriarchal control over women's sexuality
- It should be eliminated everywhere

**The Relativist Challenge:**
- Who defines what counts as "mutilation"? (The West accepts male circumcision, ear piercing, cosmetic surgery)
- Many women support and perpetuate the practice—are they victims of false consciousness?
- In some contexts, FGC is an essential coming-of-age ritual, tied to identity and belonging
- Colonial-era campaigns against FGC were often racist, not genuinely concerned with women's welfare
- Effective change must come from within communities, not imposed from outside

**The Nuanced Anthropological Position:**
Anthropologists studying FGC work to:
1. **Understand** why women participate (social pressure, positive identity formation, marriage requirements, aesthetic preferences)
2. **Document** the harms without sensationalizing or reducing complex practices to simplistic "barbarism"
3. **Support** community-led efforts for change that respect local values
4. **Critique** both the practice AND the often-racist Western discourse about it

This isn't moral relativism (accepting FGC as fine). It's recognizing that effective change requires understanding, not just condemnation.

### Other Challenging Cases

**Human Sacrifice (historical):**
Aztec human sacrifice horrified Spanish conquistadors, who used it to justify conquest. Yet the Spanish Inquisition was burning people alive at the same time. Anthropologists studying Aztec sacrifice ask:
- What religious cosmology made it meaningful?
- How did it function politically and socially?
- What did participants experience?

This doesn't justify killing—it seeks to understand why a complex civilization incorporated it, and what it meant to them.

**Controversial Contemporary Practices:**
- **Honor killings:** How do we understand cultures that value family honor over individual life while still advocating for women's rights?
- **Child labor:** In some contexts, children's work is economic necessity and valued contribution. How do we distinguish this from exploitation?
- **Corporal punishment:** Cultural variation in discipline raises questions about universal children's rights

## The Boundaries of Relativism: Where Anthropologists Draw Lines

### Consensus on Some Limits

Most contemporary anthropologists agree that cultural relativism has limits:

1. **Genocide and mass violence** cannot be defended through cultural arguments
2. **Slavery** violates fundamental human dignity
3. **Torture** crosses ethical boundaries regardless of cultural context
4. **Some practices involving children** (sexual abuse, extreme violence) warrant intervention

### The Ongoing Debate

But consensus breaks down on many issues:
- At what age can someone meaningfully consent to cultural practices?
- Who defines what counts as "harm"?
- How do we balance collective rights (cultural preservation) against individual rights?
- Can economic and social rights be prioritized over political rights, or vice versa?

**Anthropologist Elvin Hatch** argued for a "principled relativism" that:
- Uses relativism as method (understand first)
- Recognizes some universal ethical standards (human dignity, autonomy, well-being)
- Acknowledges these standards themselves require ongoing debate and revision

## Eating: A Less Fraught Example

Food practices offer a gentler way to understand cultural relativism:

> **Insects, Dogs, and Cows**
>
> **Americans** find eating insects disgusting but happily consume lobster (which are essentially large sea insects). They're horrified by cultures that eat dogs but see no problem with eating pigs (which are equally intelligent and emotionally complex).
>
> **Hindus** find American beef consumption morally abhorrent—killing and eating a sacred being. From their perspective, Americans are committing religious sacrilege daily.
>
> **Many cultures** find insects nutritious, sustainable, and delicious. Western disgust seems irrational to them.
>
> None of these reactions are "natural." All are culturally learned. Cultural relativism helps us recognize that our food taboos are just as arbitrary as anyone else's.

> **The Mortuary Cannibalism Debate**
>
> Some Amazonian groups traditionally practiced mortuary cannibalism—eating small portions of a deceased relative's body as a sign of respect and to keep their spirit within the community. When Western missionaries and governments discovered this, they were horrified and banned it.
>
> But anthropologists noted: From the practitioners' perspective, the Western practice of putting loved ones' bodies in the ground to rot was far more disrespectful and horrifying. What could be worse than abandoning your family member to decay alone in the cold earth?
>
> Neither practice involves harming others. Both express cultural ideas about death, the body, and respect for the deceased. Cultural relativism doesn't require you to practice mortuary cannibalism—just to understand that your own mortuary practices aren't naturally "right."

## Relativism and Power

Critical anthropologists point out that cultural relativism itself can be weaponized:

### When Relativism Harms

- **Dictators** invoke cultural relativism to deflect human rights criticism: "Democracy is Western—we have Asian values"
- **Elites** preserve their power by calling inequality "traditional culture"
- **Relativism** can become an excuse for inaction: "Who are we to judge?"

### When Relativism Helps

- **Indigenous peoples** use relativism to defend their rights against assimilation
- **Activists** use it to challenge Western hegemony and assert local values
- **Researchers** use it to avoid imposing harmful foreign standards

The key question: **Who is invoking relativism, and for what purpose?**

## Cultural Relativism in Practice: How Anthropologists Navigate It

### Respect Without Approval

Anthropologist Paul Stoller studied spirit possession in Niger. He didn't have to believe in spirits to respect that practitioners' experiences were real *to them* and meaningful in their cultural context.

### Critical Engagement

Anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod studies women in Muslim societies. She argues against simplistic "rescue narratives" that portray all Muslim women as oppressed. But she also doesn't romanticize—she documents how women negotiate, resist, and sometimes suffer within patriarchal systems. Understanding doesn't preclude critique.

### Reflexivity About One's Own Position

Good anthropological practice requires examining your own cultural assumptions:
- Why does this practice disturb you?
- What values are you bringing to your judgment?
- How would people from this culture view your practices?
- Are you seeing clearly or through ethnocentric bias?

---

## Contemporary Debates Within Anthropology

### The "Decolonizing Anthropology" Challenge

Some scholars argue that cultural relativism itself is a Western concept imposed on others:
- It assumes cultures are discrete units (a colonial construction)
- It puts anthropologists in the position of judging where relativism ends
- It can erase power differences and colonial histories

### Engaged Anthropology

Many contemporary anthropologists reject the stance of "neutral observer." They argue anthropologists should:
- Advocate for the communities they study
- Use their knowledge to fight injustice
- Take ethical stances on harmful practices
- But do so in dialogue with communities, not imposing from outside

### Human Rights and Universalism

The **Universal Declaration of Human Rights** claims certain rights are universal regardless of culture. But anthropologists note:
- The declaration was written primarily by Western powers
- Different cultures emphasize different rights (collective vs. individual, economic vs. political)
- "Universal" often means "Western"

Is a truly cross-cultural ethics possible? Or is universalism always disguised particularism?

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Where would YOU draw the line on cultural relativism? Is there a practice you've heard about that you absolutely cannot understand or accept? Why that one?

**Question 2:** Can you think of a practice from your own culture that people from other cultures find shocking or immoral? How does it feel to have your cultural practices judged by someone else's standards?

**Question 3:** Is there a difference between understanding why people do something and condoning it? Can you fully understand without some degree of acceptance?

**Question 4:** Who gets to decide what practices are "harmful enough" to warrant intervention? What are the dangers if this power isn't carefully considered?

**Question 5:** Think about practices you judge in other cultures. Now think about practices in your culture that serve similar functions (control, belonging, identity, tradition). Are your reactions truly about the practice, or about cultural difference itself?

## Practical Applications

### Healthcare

Medical anthropologists use cultural relativism to improve healthcare:
- Understanding why patients might reject treatments
- Recognizing that Western biomedicine is itself a cultural system, not "universal truth"
- Integrating traditional healing practices where appropriate
- Respecting different cultural ideas about the body, death, and disease

### International Development

Early development programs failed catastrophically by imposing Western models. Cultural relativism teaches:
- Local knowledge is valuable, not ignorant
- One-size-fits-all solutions rarely work
- Communities should lead their own development
- "Progress" is culturally defined

### Education

Teachers working with students from diverse backgrounds use cultural relativism to:
- Recognize different learning styles and values as equally valid
- Avoid labeling difference as deficiency
- Build on students' cultural knowledge
- Create inclusive environments

### Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution

Understanding how different cultures conceptualize honor, justice, time, and relationships is crucial for:
- International negotiations
- Post-conflict reconciliation
- Peacekeeping missions
- Cross-cultural mediation

## The Ongoing Challenge

Cultural relativism remains anthropology's most important and most contested principle. It requires holding two thoughts simultaneously:

1. **Understanding is essential:** We must try to see the world as others see it
2. **Ethics matter:** Some practices cause genuine harm and warrant opposition

The anthropological approach is neither uncritical acceptance nor ethnocentric condemnation, but rather:
- **Deep understanding** of why practices exist
- **Recognition** of our own cultural biases
- **Honest grappling** with ethical complexities
- **Humility** about the limits of our knowledge
- **Collaboration** with communities for positive change

As anthropologist Clifford Geertz wrote: "The aim is not to answer the deepest questions but to make available answers that others have given... and thus to include them in the consultable record of what [humanity] has said."

**Final Thought:** Cultural relativism doesn't ask you to abandon your values. It asks you to recognize that your values are cultural too—and that understanding why others hold different values might lead to more effective engagement than simple condemnation.
