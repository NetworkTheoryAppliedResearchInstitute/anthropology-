# Primate Intelligence and Culture: Cognition, Tools, and Learning

---

## Defining Intelligence

### What Is Intelligence?

**Challenges:**
- Anthropocentric definitions
- Multiple intelligences
- Domain-specific vs. general

**Primate Intelligence:**
- Problem-solving
- Learning
- Memory
- Social cognition
- Innovation
- Flexibility

**Not Linear "Scala Naturae":**
- Each species intelligent for its niche
- Humans not "top"
- Different kinds of intelligence

---

## Brain Size and Intelligence

### Bigger Brains?

**Encephalization Quotient (EQ):**
- Brain size relative to body size
- Humans highest
- Apes high
- Monkeys intermediate
- But: not perfect measure

**Neocortex:**
- Especially large in primates
- Sensory processing
- Cognition
- Social intelligence

**Robin Dunbar:**
- "Social Brain Hypothesis"
- Neocortex size correlates with group size
- Large brains for social complexity
- Not tool use primarily

---

## Tool Use

### Using Objects to Solve Problems

**Tool Use Widespread:**
- Not unique to humans
- But: humans most elaborate

**Chimpanzees:**

**Jane Goodall (1960s):**
- Gombe, Tanzania
- Revolutionary observations
- Chimps use tools!

**Examples:**
- Termite fishing (insert stick in mound)
- Ant dipping (dip stick, lick ants)
- Nut cracking (hammer stones, anvils)
- Leaf sponges (water)
- Weapons (throw branches, rocks)

**Regional Variation:**
- Different populations use different tools
- Cultural transmission
- Not genetic

**Tai Forest, Ivory Coast:**
- Christophe Boesch
- Sophisticated nut-cracking
- Mothers teach offspring
- "Scaffold" learning

**Capuchin Monkeys:**
- New World monkeys
- Use stones to crack nuts
- Dorothy Fragaszy, Susan Perry research
- Convergent evolution with chimps

**Orangutans:**
- Carel van Schaik
- Use sticks to extract insects
- "Aha" moment (insight learning)
- Culture varies between populations

**New Caledonian Crows:**
- Not primates, but relevant
- Make hooked tools
- More sophisticated than some primates!
- Intelligence can evolve independently

## Culture in Primates

### Socially Transmitted Behavior

**Culture Definition:**
- Learned from others
- Transmitted socially (not genetic)
- Varies between groups

**Do Primates Have Culture?**

**Whiten et al. (1999):**
- Compared chimp populations
- 39 behaviors vary culturally
- Not explained by genetics or environment
- "Chimpanzee Cultures"

**Examples:**
- Tool use techniques
- Grooming styles (hand-clasp grooming in some)
- Courtship displays
- Food processing

**Orangutans:**
- Van Schaik et al.
- 24 cultural variants
- Kiss-squeaking (alarm)
- Tool use patterns

**Japanese Macaques:**

**Koshima Island:**
- Kinji Imanishi, Japanese primatology
- Sweet potato washing
- **Imo** (female) innovated (1953)
- Spread to others
- Wheat washing (separate wheat from sand)
- Cultural tradition

**Snow Monkeys:**
- Hot spring bathing (Jigokudani)
- Initiated by young female
- Spread through troop
- Now tourist attraction

**Debate:**
- Is this culture?
- Simpler than human culture
- But: socially learned, traditional

**Michael Tomasello:**
- "Ratchet Effect"
- Humans accumulate culture
- Build on previous generations
- Primates lack cumulative culture
- Each generation relearns

---

## Social Cognition

### Understanding Others

**Theory of Mind:**
- Understanding others have minds
- Beliefs, desires, intentions

**Do Primates Have Theory of Mind?**

**Premack & Woodruff (1978):**
- "Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?"
- Debated for decades

**Evidence FOR:**
- Tactical deception (Byrne & Whiten)
  - Chimps mislead others
  - Suggests understanding others' knowledge
- Gaze following
- Intentional communication

**Evidence AGAINST:**
- Many "mind-reading" explainable by behavior-reading
- Don't pass false-belief tests (like human children)
- Limited perspective-taking

**Current View:**
- Some understanding of others' goals, perceptions
- But: not full human-like theory of mind
- Differences in degree

**Daniel Povinelli:**
- Skeptic
- Chimps understand behavior, not mental states

**Josep Call, Michael Tomasello:**
- Chimps understand seeing, goals
- But: not beliefs

---

## Self-Awareness

### Mirror Self-Recognition

**Gordon Gallup (1970):**
- Mirror test
- Mark on face (anesthesia)
- Does animal recognize self in mirror?

**Pass Mirror Test:**
- Great apes (chimps, bonobos, orangutans, gorillas)
- Some unclear (gorillas rare)
- Dolphins, elephants, magpies

**Not Pass:**
- Monkeys (generally)

**What Does It Mean?**
- Self-awareness?
- Bodily self-awareness?
- Not definitive proof of consciousness

---

## Language Experiments

### Can Apes Learn Language?

**Why Try?**
- Test cognitive limits
- Evolution of language

**Early Attempts:**
- Raised chimps like children
- Teach spoken language
- Failed (vocal anatomy)

**Sign Language:**

**Washoe (1960s-70s):**
- Allen and Beatrix Gardner
- American Sign Language
- Learned ~350 signs
- Combinations ("water bird" for swan)

**Koko (Gorilla):**
- Francine Patterson
- 1,000+ signs (claimed)
- Emotional, creative?
- Controversies (interpretation)

**Nim Chimpsky:**
- Herbert Terrace
- Named after Noam Chomsky
- Initially successful
- **Terrace concluded: NOT language**
- No syntax
- Imitation, cues
- "Clever Hans" effect

**Lexigrams:**

**Kanzi (Bonobo):**
- Sue Savage-Rumbaugh
- Keyboard with symbols (lexigrams)
- Learned by observation (not training!)
- Understands spoken English
- Follows novel commands
- Syntax? (limited)

**Most Impressive Results:**
- But: still not human language
- No recursion
- Limited grammar
- Small vocabulary
- No generativity

**Chomsky:**
- Universal Grammar (humans only)
- Language = discontinuity

**Debate:**
- Continuity vs. discontinuity
- Language unique, or degree?

---

## Numerical Cognition

### Understanding Quantities

**Can Primates Count?**

**Experiments:**
- Choose larger quantity
- Match numerosities
- Ordering

**Results:**
- Chimps, monkeys can discriminate quantities
- Approximate (not exact counting)
- Similar to human infants

**Ai (Chimpanzee):**
- Tetsuro Matsuzawa, Japan
- Number learning
- Touch numbers in order (1-9)
- **Faster than humans!**
- Memory amazing

---

## Memory

### Primates Remember

**Spatial Memory:**
- Remember food locations
- Chimps, monkeys excel
- Foraging efficiency

**Social Memory:**
- Remember relationships
- Grudges (chimps)
- Alliances

**Episodic Memory?**
- Remembering specific events
- Debated
- Some evidence in apes

**Ayumu (Chimpanzee):**
- Matsuzawa's son of Ai
- Working memory test
- Numbers flash briefly
- Recall position
- **Outperforms humans**
- Better visual memory

---

## Problem-Solving

### Innovation

**Insight Learning:**
- "Aha!" moment
- Not trial-and-error

**Wolfgang Köhler (1920s):**
- Chimps on Tenerife
- Stack boxes to reach banana
- Use sticks
- Insight

**Innovativeness:**
- Some individuals more innovative
- Personality differences

**Examples:**
- Chimps open difficult puzzles
- Orangutans solve mechanical problems
- Capuchins creative

---

## Cooperation

### Working Together

**Chimpanzees:**
- Group hunting
- Cooperation (Boesch, Tai Forest)
- Roles (drivers, blockers, ambushers)

**But:**
- Don't share goals mentally
- Less coordinated than humans

**Elephants:**
- More cooperative than chimps (some tasks)
- Must coordinate

**Humans Unique:**
- Shared intentionality (Tomasello)
- Joint attention
- Collaborative goals

---

## Deception

### Tactical Deception

**Richard Byrne & Andrew Whiten:**
- "Machiavellian Intelligence"
- Primates deceive
- Suggests understanding others

**Examples:**
- Hide food from dominants
- False alarm calls (get food while others flee)
- Conceal mating
- Lead others away from food

**Baboons:**
- Female screams (get male to attack rival)
- Not provoked, manipulative

**Chimps:**
- Suppress vocalizations near food (if subordinate)
- Sneak matings

---

## Empathy and Helping

### Do Primates Care?

**Frans de Waal:**
- Empathy in primates
- Consolation (comfort victims)
- Bonobos especially

**Examples:**
- Chimps console after fights
- Bonobos share food
- Capuchins show fairness (inequity aversion)

**Helping:**
- Usually kin
- Some helping non-kin (bonobos, capuchins)

**Debate:**
- True empathy or self-interest?
- Continuum with humans

---

## Fairness and Morality

### Proto-Morality?

**Sarah Brosnan:**
- Capuchin fairness experiment
- Cucumber vs. grape
- Reject unequal pay
- "Inequity aversion"

**Interpretation:**
- Sense of fairness?
- Or: disappointment at not getting better?

**De Waal:**
- Building blocks of morality
- Empathy, reciprocity, fairness
- Evolved in primates
- Humans elaborate

---

## Personality

### Individual Differences

**Primates Have Personalities:**
- Bold vs. shy
- Aggressive vs. peaceful
- Curious vs. cautious

**Five-Factor Model:**
- Human personality (Big Five)
- Applied to chimps
- Similar dimensions found

**Implications:**
- Personality not uniquely human
- Evolutionary roots

---

## Captivity vs. Wild

### Where to Study?

**Captivity Advantages:**
- Controlled experiments
- Complex tasks
- Language training
- Close observation

**Wild Advantages:**
- Natural behavior
- Ecological validity
- Social complexity
- Ethical (less intervention)

**Debate:**
- Captivity shows potential
- Wild shows actual behavior
- Both valuable

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Do chimpanzees have culture, or is it too different from human culture?

**Question 2:** Can apes learn language, or just imitate?

**Question 3:** Is intelligence a single thing, or many different capacities?

**Question 4:** Do primates have morality, or just behaviors that look moral?

**Question 5:** How much of human uniqueness is degree vs. kind?

**Remember:** Primate intelligence is diverse, domain-specific, not linear hierarchy. Brain size (EQ), neocortex size correlated with social complexity (Dunbar's social brain hypothesis). Tool use widespread: Goodall's chimps (termite fishing, nut-cracking), Tai Forest teaching, capuchins converge with chimps, orangutans innovate. Culture in primates: Whiten 39 chimp behaviors cultural, Japanese macaques potato washing (Imo), regional variation tool use. Social cognition: theory of mind debated (Premack & Woodruff), tactical deception (Byrne & Whiten), some understanding goals/perceptions not beliefs. Mirror self-recognition in great apes (Gallup). Language experiments: Washoe ASL, Nim Chimpsky (Terrace concluded NOT language), Kanzi bonobo (lexigrams, understands English), no true language (no syntax/recursion/generativity). Numerical cognition, memory (Ayumu outperforms humans visual memory). Problem-solving, cooperation (Boesch group hunting), deception. Empathy/helping (de Waal consolation), fairness (Brosnan inequity aversion). Personality individual differences. Understanding primate intelligence reveals evolutionary roots of human cognition, continuities and discontinuities, culture/tool use/social cognition ancient but humans unique in degree and cumulative culture.
