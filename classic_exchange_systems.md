# Classic Exchange Systems: Ethnographic Depth

## The Kula Ring: Malinowski's Discovery

### The Scene: Arriving in the Trobriands

**1915, Bronislaw Malinowski:**

Stranded in Papua New Guinea during WWI, Malinowski did something revolutionary—he **pitched his tent in the middle of a Trobriand village** and lived there for years.

> **From his diary:**
> 
> "Feeling of ownership: it is I who will describe them or create them... I see the life of the natives as utterly devoid of interest or importance, something as remote from me as the life of a dog."
>
> (His published ethnography was far more sympathetic—the diary revealed private prejudices he overcame professionally.)

**What he discovered:** A vast ceremonial exchange network linking islands across hundreds of miles—the **kula ring**.

### The Kula System

**Geographic Scope:**
- Trobriand Islands
- Kitava, Vakuta, Kaileuna
- Dobu, Tubetube, Woodlark
- Marshall Bennett Islands
- Thousands of square miles of ocean

**Two Types of Valuables:**

**Soulava (Veigun):**
- Long necklaces of red shell disks
- Travel **clockwise** around the ring
- Some famous, with names and histories

**Mwali:**
- White shell armbands
- Travel **counterclockwise** around the ring
- Decorated, polished

**The Flow:**
```
        Island A
       ↗ soulava ↘
 Island D        Island B
       ↖ mwali  ↙
        Island C
```

### The Rules (Strict)

**1. Never Barter:**
- Kula items are **gifts**, not commodities
- To haggle = deeply offensive
- "This is not trade, this is kula"

**2. Must Have Partners:**
- Established partnerships (sometimes inherited)
- May have partners on multiple islands
- Lifelong relationships
- Obligations

**3. Direction is Fixed:**
- Soulava only clockwise
- Mwali only counterclockwise
- Never reverse

**4. Cannot Keep Forever:**
- Hold for months or years
- Then pass to another partner
- Continuous circulation

**5. Equivalence Expected:**
- If receive valuable soulava, must eventually give valuable mwali
- Roughly balanced over time
- But strategic variation

### What Gets Exchanged Alongside

**Kula = Ceremonial Exchange:**
- Valuables with no practical use
- Pure prestige

**Gimwali = Utilitarian Trade:**
- Pottery, food, tools, canoes
- Accompanies kula expeditions
- But kept separate conceptually
- Can haggle over gimwali, never kula

**Critical Distinction:**
Malinowski showed same people distinguish sacred/profane, gift/commodity.

### The Kula Expedition

> **Preparing:**
>
> Months of work:
> - Build or repair outrigger canoe
> - Gather trade goods (gimwali)
> - Magic spells for protection, success
> - Beauty magic (make yourself attractive to partners)
> - Canoe magic (speed, safety)
>
> **The Journey:**
>
> Dangerous ocean voyage:
> - Days paddling between islands
> - Storms, sharks, enemy islands
> - Magical protection essential
> - Arrive at partner's village
>
> **The Exchange:**
>
> Formal, ritualized:
> - Initial visits (no kula yet)
> - Receive gifts (food, betel nut)
> - Partner eventually presents kula valuable
> - Accept graciously (never immediately reciprocate)
> - Engage in gimwali trade
> - Return home
>
> **Months/Years Later:**
>
> Partner visits you:
> - You reciprocate with valuable traveling opposite direction
> - Cycle continues

### Famous Valuables

**Named, with Histories:**

**Like "the Hope Diamond" of shell:**
- "Gumakarakedakeda" (legendary necklace)
- Stories of previous owners
- Where it traveled
- Battles fought over it
- Who holds it = prestige

**Value Comes From:**
- Age (older = better)
- Beauty (polished, perfect)
- **History** (who possessed it)
- Fame (known throughout kula ring)

**Not Intrinsic Value:**
- Social construction
- Biography of object

### Functions of Kula

**1. Peace and Alliance:**
- Links hostile islands
- Can't war with kula partners
- Trade follows kula ties
- Intermarriage between partners' families

**2. Prestige and Rank:**
- Big men have many partners
- Famous valuables = high status
- Reputation through generosity and timing
- Political power

**3. Adventure and Excitement:**
- Dangerous voyages
- Exotic travel
- Stories to tell
- Male bonding

**4. Total Social System:**
- Economic (gimwali trade)
- Political (alliances)
- Religious (magic integral)
- Social (partnerships)
- Aesthetic (beauty of valuables)

**Malinowski's Insight:** Economy embedded in total social life—can't separate.

### Malinowski's Theoretical Contributions

**Against "Primitive Mentality":**
- Trobrianders perfectly rational
- Complex system, internally logical
- Not simple or childlike

**Gift vs. Commodity:**
- Kula shows gift economy
- Separate from utilitarian trade
- Different logic

**Functionalism:**
- Kula functions to integrate society
- Creates social solidarity
- Maintains peace

**Critique:**
- Too functionalist (no conflict, change)
- Male-focused (ignored women's wealth—Weiner's later critique)
- Romanticized harmony

### Kula Today

**Still Practiced:**
- Modified by modernity
- Motorboats replace canoes (some)
- Cash economy alongside
- Tourism impact
- Government attempts to commodify

**Persistence:**
- Cultural identity
- Resist full commodification
- Meaning beyond economics

**Challenges:**
- Younger generation less interested
- Migration to cities
- State interference
- Climate change (ocean travel)

## Potlatch: Competitive Generosity on the Northwest Coast

### The Setting

**Pacific Northwest Coast:**
- British Columbia, Alaska coast
- Kwakwaka'wakw, Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, Nuu-chah-nulth

**Environment:**
- Rich marine resources (salmon, seal, whale)
- Forests (cedar)
- Seasonal abundance
- Storable wealth

**Social Organization:**
- Ranked society (chiefs, commoners, slaves)
- Hereditary titles
- Lineages/clans
- Competition for status

### What Is Potlatch?

**Chinook Jargon:** "Potlatch" = to give

**Ceremonial Feast:**
- Host invites hundreds
- Gives away massive wealth
- Destroys valuables
- Guests witness, validate claims

**Occasions:**
- Marriages
- Deaths (memorial potlatches)
- Raising totem poles
- Naming ceremonies
- Inheriting titles
- Coming of age

### The Spectacle

> **A Kwakwaka'wakw Potlatch (Historical Account):**
>
> Chief stands before assembled guests:
> - Hundreds of people
> - Rival chiefs watching
>
> **The Giving:**
> - "I am the great chief!"
> - Throws Hudson's Bay blankets to guests
> - Hundreds, thousands of blankets
> - Copper plates (valuable shields)
> - Canoes
> - Food (mountains of food)
>
> **The Destruction:**
> - Breaks copper plate (extreme wealth)
> - Pours fish oil on fire (massive flames)
> - "I am so wealthy I destroy what you treasure!"
>
> **The Challenge:**
> - "Can you match this?"
> - Rival chief must respond
> - Host more, give more, destroy more
> - Or be shamed

### The Economics

**Accumulation:**
- Chief accumulates wealth over years
- Lineage members contribute
- Borrow from others
- Prepare for potlatch

**Distribution:**
- All given away or destroyed
- Guests by rank (high status get more)
- Carefully recorded (oral memory)
- Witnesses remember amounts

**Obligation to Return:**
- Guests must eventually potlatch
- Return **more** than received
- Interest accumulates
- Can't return = subordinate status

**Result:**
- Wealth circulates
- Can't accumulate indefinitely
- Convert wealth to prestige

### The Competitive Escalation

**Rivalry Between Chiefs:**

> **Chief A potlatches:**
> - Gives 1,000 blankets
> - Chief B receives portion
>
> **Chief B must respond:**
> - Gives 1,500 blankets
> - Shames Chief A
> - Chief A receives portion
>
> **Chief A escalates:**
> - Gives 2,000 blankets
> - **And** breaks copper plate worth hundreds more
> - "I destroy what you give away!"
>
> **Arms race of generosity**

**Can Lead to:**
- Impoverishment (gave too much)
- Debt (borrowed to potlatch)
- Subordination (couldn't match)

**But Also:**
- Enormous prestige
- Validated claims to titles
- Lineage glory

### Franz Boas's Study

**1890s Fieldwork:**

**"The Social Organization and Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl" (1897):**

**Documented:**
- Detailed speeches
- Amounts given
- Names, relationships
- Ritual procedures
- Competitive dynamics

**Interpretation:**
- Status competition
- Rank maintenance
- Validates inheritance
- Legal system (witnesses)

**Famous Quote:**
"The Indian loves to pose... He is vain... and fond of display."

(Ethnocentric but recognized system's logic.)

### Ruth Benedict's Interpretation

**"Patterns of Culture" (1934):**

**Kwakiutl = "Dionysian":**
- Excess, exuberance
- Megalomania
- Aggressive, competitive
- Contrasted with "Apollonian" Pueblos

**Criticism:**
- Overgeneralized
- Pathologized
- Reflected colonial prejudices

**But Influential:**
- Culture patterns idea
- Configuration approach

### Colonial Suppression

**Canadian "Potlatch Ban" (1884-1951):**

**Legal:**
- Indian Act Section 114
- Outlawed potlatch and Tamanawas dances
- Punishable by imprisonment

**Rationale:**
- "Wasteful," "anti-civilizational"
- Impediment to wage labor
- Christian missionaries opposed ("pagan")
- Assimilation policy

**Enforcement:**
- Arrests, confiscations
- 1921 mass arrest (Kwakwaka'wakw)
- Potlatch regalia confiscated (museums)
- Cultural destruction

**Resistance:**
- Continued secretly
- Smaller, hidden potlatches
- Cultural persistence

**Repeal (1951):**
- Ban lifted
- Cultural revival
- Repatriation of regalia (ongoing)

### Reinterpretations

**Ecological Adaptation (Codere, Suttles):**

**Potlatch as:**
- Redistribution mechanism
- Levels inequality
- Risk insurance (help in need)
- Circulates surplus

**Not Wasteful:**
- Feeds everyone
- Helps poor
- Prevents hoarding
- Functional

**Political Economy (Wolf, Walens):**

**Potlatch:**
- Maintains class structure
- Chiefs extract from commoners
- Redistribute to validate authority
- Ideology of generosity masks exploitation

**Debate:** Equalizing or hierarchical?

### Contemporary Potlatches

**Legal Again (since 1951):**
- Cultural revival
- Modified forms
- Smaller scale typically

**Modern Adaptations:**
- Cash, store-bought goods
- Community halls (not traditional houses)
- Fewer days (not weeks)
- But core logic persists

**Functions Today:**
- Cultural identity
- Validate claims (inheritance, names)
- Strengthen community
- Resist commodification

**Challenges:**
- Expensive (hard to afford)
- Generational change
- State recognition of titles
- Commercialization pressures

## Highland New Guinea: Moka and Tee

### The Setting

**Papua New Guinea Highlands:**
- Mt. Hagen region (Melpa/Hagen)
- Enga (Tee)
- Dense population
- Sweet potato horticulture
- Pigs central

**Social Organization:**
- "Big men" (not hereditary chiefs)
- Achieved status
- Competitive leadership
- No centralized authority

### The Moka Exchange (Melpa)

**Andrew Strathern's Study (1970s):**

**Moka = Ceremonial Gift:**
- Pigs, pearlshells, cassowaries
- Between clans, individuals
- Delayed reciprocity
- Competitive

**Big Men:**
- Organize moka
- Persuade supporters
- Build partnerships
- Demonstrate leadership

> **The Process:**
>
> **Years of Preparation:**
> - Big man accumulates pigs
> - Supporters contribute
> - Build networks
> - Negotiate partnerships
>
> **The Moka Ceremony:**
> - Hundreds gather
> - Pigs tied to stakes (dozens, hundreds)
> - Pearlshells displayed
> - Speeches: "I give more than I received!"
> - Recipients must eventually return more
>
> **The Count:**
> - Exact tallies
> - Everyone watches
> - Reputation made/lost
> - More than received = victory

**Functions:**

**1. Alliance:**
- Links clans
- Peace through exchange
- Marriage follows moka partners

**2. Status Competition:**
- Big men compete
- Supporters gain reflected glory
- Can't lead without successful moka

**3. Conflict Resolution:**
- Compensation for killings
- Warfare → moka exchange
- Converts enemies to partners

**4. Social Mobility:**
- Achieved status (not birth)
- Anyone can become big man
- But requires skill, labor, persuasion

### The Tee Exchange (Enga)

**Larger Scale:**
- Involves entire tribes
- Thousands of people
- Massive pig distributions

**The Tee Cycle:**
- Years between major ceremonies
- Accumulation phase
- Massive simultaneous exchanges
- Resets relationships

**Functions Similarly:**
- Warfare → peace
- Competition
- Big men leadership
- But grander scale

### Pigs and Prestige

**Why Pigs?**

**Economic:**
- Store wealth (living banks)
- Reproduce (grow wealth)
- Portable
- Consumable (feast)

**Social:**
- Women raise pigs
- Men exchange pigs
- Gender division of labor

**Symbolic:**
- Prestige animals
- Size matters (tusked boars valuable)
- Names, individual identities
- "My children" (women's connection)

**Tension:**
- Women's labor produces
- Men's exchange creates prestige
- Gender inequality

**Josephides, Lederman:**
- Women resist
- "Pig payments" to women
- Negotiate value

### Comparing Kula, Moka, Potlatch

**Similarities:**
- Competitive giving
- Prestige through generosity
- Delayed reciprocity
- More than material exchange
- Create alliances

**Differences:**

| Feature | Kula | Potlatch | Moka |
|---------|------|----------|------|
| Items | Shells (valuables) | Blankets, coppers, food | Pigs, shells |
| Circulation | Continuous, circular | Reciprocal, bilateral | Reciprocal, bilateral |
| Destruction | No | Yes (extreme) | No |
| Leadership | Big men | Hereditary chiefs | Big men (achieved) |
| Scale | Inter-island (vast) | Local/regional | Inter-clan |

**Theoretical Importance:**

All show:
- Gift economy ≠ commodity economy
- Exchange creates society
- Rationality in non-market contexts
- Economy embedded

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is potlatch "wasteful" or does that judgment impose market logic?

**Question 2:** Could kula, moka, or potlatch work in modern capitalist societies?

**Question 3:** Are these systems egalitarian (redistribute) or hierarchical (concentrate power)?

**Question 4:** What would Mauss say about cryptocurrency as modern "kula"?

**Question 5:** Do contemporary "influencers" engage in potlatch-like status competition?

**Remember:** These classic exchange systems reveal fundamental truths about human economy: exchange creates social relationships, prestige comes through giving not accumulating, competition can be about generosity, and valuables carry histories and meanings beyond material worth. Kula shows gift exchange can organize vast networks peacefully. Potlatch shows wealth destroyed to create prestige—seemingly "irrational" in market terms but perfectly logical in status competition. Moka shows big men must give to lead. All challenge assumptions that economy is just about material self-interest. These aren't "primitive" or "exotic"—they're sophisticated social systems organizing production, distribution, power, and meaning. Understanding them expands our conception of economic possibility.
