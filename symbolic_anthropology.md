# Symbolic and Interpretive Anthropology: Culture as Text (1960s-1980s)

---

## The Interpretive Revolution

By the 1960s, anthropology was ready for a paradigm shift. Functionalism seemed mechanistic, structuralism seemed abstract and ahistorical, culture and personality seemed reductive. Something was missing.

**Clifford Geertz** (1926-2006) offered a radically different approach: **Stop treating culture like a machine or a code. Treat it like a text to be interpreted.**

**The key shift:**
- **From:** How does culture function? What are the underlying structures?
- **To:** What does culture mean? How do people create and interpret meaning?

This was **interpretive anthropology** (also called **symbolic anthropology**)—perhaps the most influential theoretical framework in late 20th-century anthropology.

## Core Concepts of Interpretive Anthropology

### 1. Culture as "Webs of Significance"

**Geertz's Famous Definition:**

> *"Believing, with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning."*

**What This Means:**

**Culture is:**
- Systems of meaning
- Symbolic structures
- Webs of significance
- Publicly available symbolic forms

**Culture is NOT:**
- Hidden rules or structures
- Psychological states
- Biological adaptations
- Social mechanisms

**Anthropology should:**
- Interpret meanings
- Understand symbolic systems
- Read culture like a text

**Anthropology should NOT:**
- Search for universal laws
- Identify underlying structures
- Explain by functions
- Reduce to psychology or biology

### 2. Thick Description

**Geertz's Most Famous Concept:**

**Borrowed from philosopher Gilbert Ryle:**

> **Example: The Wink**
>
> **Thin description:** An eyelid contracts.
>
> **Thick description:** A wink—a voluntary movement signaling conspiracy, humor, or flirtation. Different from a twitch (involuntary), a parody of a wink (rehearsing), a fake wink (pretending to signal), etc.
>
> **The point:** Understanding requires grasping the multiple layers of meaning, not just describing physical behavior.

**Thick Description Means:**

1. **Describe behavior in context**
2. **Interpret what it means to participants**
3. **Explain cultural frameworks that make it meaningful**
4. **Show layers of significance**
5. **Connect to broader cultural patterns**

**NOT just:**
- Detailed description (it's not "thick" because it's long)
- Objective observation
- Causal explanation

### 3. Culture as Public and Symbolic

**Against psychological reductionism:**

Culture doesn't exist "in people's heads"—it exists in public symbols, actions, texts, performances.

**Example:**
A religious ritual isn't private psychological states—it's public performance using shared symbols that anyone can observe and interpret.

**Why This Matters:**

Can study culture by interpreting publicly available meanings, not by accessing private psychological states.

### 4. Interpretation, Not Explanation

**Anthropology as Humanistic, Not Scientific:**

**Goal:** Understand meanings (interpretation, verstehen)

**NOT:** Explain causes (prediction, laws, mechanisms)

**More like:**
- Literary criticism
- Historical understanding
- Cultural critique

**Less like:**
- Natural science
- Hypothesis testing
- Causal modeling

**This was controversial!** Many anthropologists wanted anthropology to be "scientific."

## Geertz's Ethnographic Practice

### "Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight" (1973)

**Perhaps the most famous ethnographic essay ever written.**

**The Scene:**

Bali, 1950s. Geertz observes cockfights—illegal gambling events where men bet on fighting roosters.

**Surface Level:**

Men gather, attach spurs to roosters' legs, let them fight until one dies. Men bet large sums of money. Intense excitement, shouting, passion.

**The Question:**

Why are Balinese men so obsessed with cockfights? Why bet amounts that could bankrupt families?

**Functionalist Answer Would Be:**

Cockfights function to:
- Redistribute wealth
- Create alliances
- Release aggression
- Etc.

**Geertz's Interpretive Answer:**

**The cockfight is a text—a story Balinese tell themselves about themselves.**

**Layers of Meaning:**

**1. Cocks = Men:**
- Roosters (sabung) symbolically connected to men
- Grooming, admiring, caring for cocks
- Penis slang
- Cock's performance = man's status

**2. Status and Honor:**
- Betting shows willingness to risk wealth for status
- Large bets ("deep play") between status rivals
- Not economically rational—it's about honor
- Center bet between owners—public status competition
- Side bets follow kinship and alliance lines

**3. Social Drama:**
The cockfight enacts social tensions:
- Status rivalries
- Village factions
- Kinship obligations
- Hierarchies

**4. Art Form:**
The cockfight is aesthetic:
- Beautiful roosters
- Dramatic performance
- Skilled betting
- Emotional intensity

**The Interpretation:**

> *"Like any art form—for that is what we are dealing with, after all—the cockfight renders ordinary, everyday experience comprehensible by presenting it in terms of acts and objects which have had their practical consequences removed and been reduced (or, if you prefer, raised) to the level of sheer appearances, where their meaning can be more powerfully articulated and more exactly perceived."*

The cockfight is **metacommentary**—commentary on Balinese hierarchy, status, masculinity, risk. It says something about something.

Men don't gamble to redistribute wealth (economic function). They gamble to enact and contemplate their social world—to see their status anxieties dramatized.

**Like:** Shakespearean theater, modern sports, art exhibitions—activities that don't directly produce but allow reflection on social life.

**The Point:**

You can't explain the cockfight by its functions or structures. You can only interpret what it means—what story it tells about Balinese concerns with status, gender, hierarchy, risk.

## Other Interpretive Anthropologists

### Victor Turner (1920-1983): Ritual and Symbol

**Background:**
- British anthropologist (Scottish), later moved to U.S.
- Fieldwork with Ndembu (Zambia)
- Influenced by literature, drama, performance studies

**Key Concepts:**

**1. Symbols as Multivocal:**

Symbols have multiple meanings simultaneously:
- Dominant meaning (explicit, normative)
- Hidden meanings (implicit, emotional, bodily)
- Different groups interpret differently

> **Example: Milk Tree (Ndembu ritual)**
>
> **Explicit meaning:** Matriliny, motherhood, nursing
>
> **Hidden meanings:** 
> - White breast milk
> - Sexual fluids
> - Ancestral spirits
> - Social reproduction
>
> All these meanings coexist, creating rich symbolic resonance.

**2. Liminality:**

**Rituals have three stages:**
1. **Separation:** Leave normal social structure
2. **Liminality:** Betwixt and between, ambiguous
3. **Reintegration:** Return transformed

**Liminal phase is crucial:**
- Normal rules suspended
- Status ambiguous
- Communitas (anti-structural solidarity) emerges
- Transformation possible

> **Example: Initiation rituals**
>
> Boys being initiated are liminal:
> - No longer boys, not yet men
> - Naked, without possessions
> - Equal with fellow initiates (communitas)
> - Outside normal social structure
> - Return as transformed men

**3. Social Drama:**

Social conflicts follow pattern:
- **Breach:** Norm violation
- **Crisis:** Conflict escalates
- **Redress:** Intervention, ritual
- **Reintegration or schism:** Resolve or split

Rituals address social dramas—they're not just symbolic but also political.

**Turner's Contribution:**

Showed rituals are:
- Symbolically rich
- Processual (not static)
- Connected to social conflict
- Transformative (not just maintaining)

### Mary Douglas (1921-2007): Purity and Classification

**Background:**
- British anthropologist, student of Evans-Pritchard
- Influenced by Durkheim and structuralism

**Key Works:**
- *Purity and Danger* (1966)
- *Natural Symbols* (1970)

**Core Ideas:**

**1. Dirt as "Matter Out of Place":**

> What is "dirty"? 
>
> Not inherently polluting—but **violates classification systems**.
>
> **Example:**
> - Shoes on floor = clean
> - Shoes on dining table = dirty
> - Same shoes! Different location.
>
> Dirt is about **boundaries and order**.

**2. Purity Rules Protect Boundaries:**

**Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws):**
- No pork (pigs don't fit categories—cloven hooves but not ruminants)
- No shellfish (ambiguous—water creatures without fins/scales)
- Don't mix milk and meat (keep categories separate)

**Function:**
Maintaining classification system maintains social boundaries—Jewish identity.

**3. Body Symbolizes Society:**

How cultures treat the body reflects social structure:
- Tight body control = tight social control
- Loose body control = loose social structure
- Body boundaries = social boundaries

**Douglas's Contribution:**

Showed classification systems are:
- Symbolic and social
- About order and meaning
- Connected to group boundaries
- Not just cognitive but also political

## Critiques of Interpretive Anthropology

### 1. Aestheticizes Power

**Critique:** Treats culture like art, ignoring power, inequality, exploitation.

**Example:**
Geertz's cockfight—beautiful interpretation. But what about:
- Colonialism affecting Bali?
- Class divisions in who participates?
- Gender (only men at cockfights)?
- Economic inequality?

**The Problem:** Interpretation can become apolitical contemplation, ignoring material conditions and power.

### 2. Whose Interpretation?

**Critique:** Anthropologist's interpretation or native's?

If Geertz interprets cockfight as metacommentary on status, but Balinese say "we just enjoy cockfights," who's right?

**The Problem:** Interpretive authority—does anthropologist know culture better than natives?

### 3. Not Falsifiable

**Critique:** Can't prove or disprove interpretations.

Different anthropologists could interpret same cockfight differently. How do we adjudicate?

**The Problem:** If anthropology is just interpretation, is it knowledge or just stories?

### 4. Ignores History and Change

**Critique:** Treats culture as timeless text, not historical process.

Geertz studied Bali in 1950s but wrote about it as if timeless. What about:
- Dutch colonialism?
- Indonesian independence?
- Tourism?
- Change over time?

**The Problem:** Ahistorical, like functionalism before it.

### 5. Text Metaphor Limiting

**Critique:** Culture isn't just "read"—it's lived, practiced, contested, changed.

Real people:
- Have conflicting interests
- Exercise power
- Create and resist
- Live material conditions

**The Problem:** Text metaphor makes culture too coherent, static, meaning-centered.

## Postmodern Turn: Writing Culture Debates

### The Crisis of Representation (1980s)

**Question:** How do we write about others? Who has authority? What is ethnographic truth?

**"Writing Culture" (1986):**

Edited volume by James Clifford and George Marcus that transformed anthropology.

**Key Arguments:**

**1. Ethnographies Are Texts:**
Not transparent windows on reality—they're constructed narratives with literary conventions.

**2. Anthropologist as Author:**
Ethnographer's voice, position, rhetoric matter. Can't pretend to be objective observer.

**3. Partial Truths:**
All ethnographies are partial—positioned perspectives, not complete truth.

**4. Power and Representation:**
Who gets to represent whom? Colonial power dynamics in ethnographic authority.

**5. Experimental Ethnography:**
Try new forms—dialogic, polyphonic, reflexive, experimental.

**The Impact:**

**Anthropology became self-conscious about:**
- Writing and rhetoric
- Authority and power
- Partial perspectives
- Representation politics

**But also:**
- Paralyzing self-doubt for some
- Navel-gazing (critics said)
- Less confident ethnographic claims

## Legacy of Interpretive Anthropology

### What Remains:

**1. Attention to Meaning:**
Culture is about meaning-making—this insight persists.

**2. Thick Description:**
Rich, contextualized ethnographic writing became standard.

**3. Culture as Symbolic:**
Symbols, rituals, performances central to anthropological analysis.

**4. Reflexivity:**
Anthropologists acknowledge their positioned perspectives.

### What Changed:

**1. Added Power Analysis:**
Can't just interpret meaning—must analyze power, inequality, political economy.

**2. Added History:**
Culture changes—historical context essential.

**3. Added Practice:**
Not just meaning but action—what people do, not just what things mean.

**4. Added Materiality:**
Economic conditions, bodies, environments matter—not just symbols.

## Contemporary Relevance

**Where Interpretive Insights Matter:**

**Digital Culture:**
- Interpreting online communities
- Understanding memes, viral content
- Social media as symbolic systems

**Ritual Studies:**
- Weddings, funerals, graduations as meaningful performances
- Political rituals (inaugurations, protests)
- Sports as cultural texts

**Cultural Analysis:**
- Films, art, literature as ethnographic objects
- Popular culture interpretation
- Material culture and consumption

**But:** Combined with attention to power, history, political economy that interpretive anthropology sometimes neglected.

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is culture more like a text (to be read) or a practice (to be lived)? Can it be both?

**Question 2:** If ethnography is interpretation, not objective truth, does that make it subjective? How do we distinguish good from bad interpretations?

**Question 3:** Can you think of contemporary practices in your society that work like Geertz's cockfight—"deep play" that's about more than surface function?

**Question 4:** Is focusing on meaning inherently conservative (ignoring power), or can interpretation be politically engaged?

**Question 5:** Does the "crisis of representation" strengthen anthropology by making it more reflexive, or weaken it by undermining confidence in ethnographic authority?

**Remember:** Interpretive anthropology transformed the discipline by insisting culture is about meaning, not just function or structure. Geertz's "thick description" became anthropology's signature method. But critics rightly noted interpretation can ignore power, history, and material conditions. Contemporary anthropology combines interpretive insights (meaning matters, symbolism is rich, context is essential) with political economy, feminism, and historical analysis. Culture is both meaningful AND material, both symbolic AND political. Good anthropology attends to all these dimensions.
