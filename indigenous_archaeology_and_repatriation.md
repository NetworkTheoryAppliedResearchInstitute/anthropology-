# Indigenous Archaeology and Repatriation: Decolonizing the Past

---

## The Problem: Archaeology's Colonial Legacy

### Extraction and Exploitation

**Historical Pattern:**
- Archaeologists dig indigenous sites
- Remove artifacts, human remains
- Display in museums (Western)
- No consultation
- No permission
- No benefit to communities

**"Grave Robbing":**
- Indigenous perspective
- Ancestors disturbed
- Sacred objects taken
- Disrespectful

**Power Imbalance:**
- Scientists decide what's "important"
- Indigenous knowledge dismissed
- "Prehistory" (before writing = before they "mattered")

---

## Turning Point: Indigenous Activism

### 1960s-1970s

**American Indian Movement (AIM):**
- Civil rights
- Red Power
- Challenge discrimination

**Specific Actions:**

**1971: Alcatraz Occupation**
- Symbolic

**1970s: Museum Protests**
- Smithsonian, other institutions
- Display of human remains
- "Indians are people, not specimens"

**Voices:**

**Vine Deloria Jr.:**
- *Custer Died for Your Sins* (1969)
- *God Is Red* (1973)
- Critique of anthropology/archaeology
- "Indians are the only minority in America who must prove they exist"

---

## NAGPRA: Game-Changer

### Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990)

**United States Federal Law:**

**Purpose:**
- Protect Native American graves
- Repatriate human remains, funerary objects
- Return sacred objects, cultural patrimony
- Consultation requirements

**Key Provisions:**

**1. Protection of Graves:**
- On federal/tribal lands
- Illegal to excavate without permission
- Penalties

**2. Repatriation:**
- Museums, federal agencies must inventory
- Notify tribes
- Return upon request (if affiliated)

**3. Cultural Affiliation:**
- Establish relationship (tribe ↔ materials)
- Preponderance of evidence
- Oral traditions count

**4. Sacred Objects:**
- Needed for religious practices
- Must return

**5. Cultural Patrimony:**
- Communal property
- Inalienable (couldn't be sold)

**Impact:**
- Thousands of remains repatriated
- Tens of thousands of objects
- Ongoing process

## Landmark Cases

### Kennewick Man (Ancient One)

**Discovery (1996):**
- Columbia River (Washington State)
- ~9,000 years old
- Nearly complete skeleton
- James Chatters (anthropologist)

**Initial Claim:**
- "Caucasoid" features?
- NOT Native American? (disputed)

**Controversy:**
- Scientists want to study (rare, ancient)
- **Five tribes claim:**
  - Colville, Nez Perce, Umatilla, Wanapum, Yakama
  - Ancestor (NAGPRA)
  - Rebury

**Legal Battle (10 years):**
- Scientists sue (right to study)
- Tribes sue (repatriation)

**Court Ruling (2004):**
- "Cultural affiliation" NOT established
- Too old (9,000 years)
- Scientists can study

**But:**
- Tribes: oral traditions (always here)
- Scientists: migration, replacement?

**2015: DNA Analysis:**
- Genome sequenced
- **Closest living relatives: Native Americans**
- Specifically: Colville Tribe

**2016: New Law (Senator Patty Murray):**
- Ancient human remains on federal land → NAGPRA applies
- Stronger protection

**2017: Repatriation:**
- Returned to tribes
- Reburied (secret location)

**Lessons:**
- Science vs. religion
- Cultural affiliation (complex)
- Indigenous rights strengthened

---

## Collaborative Archaeology

### New Approaches

**Shift:**
- From **studying Indians** to **working with tribes**
- Consultation → collaboration → control

**Models:**

### Community-Based Archaeology

**Definition:**
- Communities involved (design, conduct, interpret)
- Research questions (relevant to community)
- Benefits (local)

**Example: Zuni (New Mexico)**
- Zuni Cultural Resource Enterprise
- Tribal members as archaeologists
- Zuni knowledge integrated
- Research serves tribe

---

## Indigenous Archaeology

### By, For, and With Indigenous Peoples

**Definition:**
- Archaeology conducted by indigenous peoples
- Or: non-indigenous in partnership (true collaboration)
- Centers indigenous knowledge, values, goals

**Principles:**

**1. Respect:**
- Sacred sites, ancestors
- Protocols (offerings, permissions)

**2. Relevance:**
- Research questions matter to community
- Not just "scientific interest"

**3. Reciprocity:**
- Mutual benefit
- Jobs, training, knowledge

**4. Control:**
- Tribes decide (what's studied, how, by whom)
- Ownership (data, materials)

---

## Examples

### Chaco Canyon (New Mexico)

**Ancestral Pueblo:**
- Descendant communities (Hopi, Zuni, others)
- Consultation (required)
- Oral traditions inform interpretation
- Ongoing sacred landscape

**Controversy:**
- Tourism (impacts)
- Sacred knowledge (what can be public?)

### Çatalhöyük (Turkey)

**Ian Hodder:**
- Post-processual archaeology
- Reflexive, inclusive
- Multiple interpretations
- Goddess figurines (feminist? Or local women's view?)

**Not Indigenous Archaeology (Turkish, not indigenous context):**
- But: collaborative model

---

## Reburial

### Returning Ancestors

**Why?**
- Respect (deceased)
- Religious beliefs (afterlife disturbed)
- Closure

**Process:**
- Repatriate remains
- Ceremony (traditional)
- Rebury (often secret location, prevent re-disturbance)

**Scientific Concerns:**
- Loss of data (future study)
- New techniques (DNA, isotopes)

**Counter:**
- Indigenous rights > scientific curiosity
- Ancestors, not "resources"
- Some tribes allow study (under conditions)

---

## Sacred Objects and Patrimony

### What Must Be Returned?

**Sacred Objects:**
- Needed for current religious practice
- Example: medicine bundles, ceremonial items

**Cultural Patrimony:**
- Communal ownership
- Inalienable (not individual's to sell)
- Example: wampum belts, totem poles

**Challenges:**
- Proving sacred status
- Museums reluctant (famous pieces)

**Example: Ghost Dance Shirts**

**Context:**
- Ghost Dance (1890, Lakota)
- Wounded Knee Massacre
- Shirts taken

**Repatriation:**
- Long battle
- Returned (some)

---

## International Context

### Beyond the United States

**Australia:**
- Aboriginal remains, objects
- Museums (British, others)
- Repatriation ongoing
- Secret-sacred objects (restricted knowledge)

**New Zealand (Aotearoa):**
- Māori
- Toi moko (tattooed heads, preserved)
  - Traded historically
  - Repatriation from museums worldwide
- Taonga (treasures)
- Treaty of Waitangi (1840, contested)

**Canada:**
- First Nations, Inuit, Métis
- Repatriation (some provinces)
- Truth and Reconciliation (residential schools)

**Latin America:**
- Complex (descendants = majority)
- National patrimony laws
- Elgin Marbles analogy? (Greece ↔ Britain)

---

## Heritage Management

### Who Owns the Past?

**Stakeholders:**
- Indigenous communities
- Nation-states
- Scientists
- Public

**Conflicts:**
- Tourism (revenue vs. respect)
- Development (construction vs. sites)
- Climate change (erosion, rising seas)

**CRM (Cultural Resource Management):**
- United States: federal law
  - Section 106 (National Historic Preservation Act)
  - Development → survey, mitigate
- Tribes consulted
- Contracts (private firms)
- Most archaeology jobs (US)

---

## Decolonizing Archaeology

### Transforming the Discipline

**Critique:**
- Archaeology = colonial
- Western categories imposed
- Marginalization

**Strategies:**

**1. Epistemic Justice:**
- Indigenous knowledge = valid
- Oral traditions = evidence
- Multiple ways of knowing

**2. Power Sharing:**
- Tribes control research
- Co-design, co-author

**3. Training:**
- Indigenous archaeologists
- Tribal colleges

**4. Language:**
- Avoid "prehistoric" (dismissive)
- "Ancestral," "ancient"

**5. Ethics:**
- Ongoing relationship
- Not "hit and run" research

---

## Tensions

### Science vs. Religion

**Remains:**
- Scientists: data (rare)
- Indigenous: ancestors (sacred)

**Resolution?**
- Case-by-case
- Some tribes allow study (conditions)
- Time limits, non-destructive

### Public vs. Private

**Sites on Private Land:**
- Looting (pothunters)
- No federal protection
- State laws vary

### Global vs. Local

**UNESCO (World Heritage):**
- "Universal value"
- But: local communities?

---

## Success Stories

### Repatriation Healing

**Example: Haida (Pacific Northwest)**
- Repatriation of ancestors
- Community ceremony
- Strengthening culture

### Tribal Museums

**National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI):**
- Smithsonian
- Indigenous curators
- Community voices
- Repatriation office

**Tribal Museums:**
- Makah (Washington)
- Akwesasne (New York)
- Zuni, Hopi, Navajo (Southwest)
- Control narratives

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Should ancient remains (10,000+ years) be repatriated?

**Question 2:** Can archaeology be decolonized, or is it inherently colonial?

**Question 3:** Who owns the past?

**Question 4:** Should all sites be preserved, or can some be developed?

**Question 5:** Is tourism at sacred sites disrespectful?
