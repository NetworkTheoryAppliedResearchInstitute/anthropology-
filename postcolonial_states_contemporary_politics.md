# Post-Colonial States, Refugees, and Contemporary Political Challenges

---

## The Post-Colonial State

### Colonial Legacies

**European Colonialism (1500s-1960s):**
- Africa, Asia, Americas, Pacific carved up
- Arbitrary borders
- Extraction economies
- Racial hierarchy
- Indirect rule through local elites

**Independence (1940s-1980s):**
- Massive wave of decolonization
- Especially 1960s Africa
- "Year of Africa" (1960—17 African states independent)

**Inherited:**
- Colonial borders (often arbitrary)
- Weak institutions
- Extraction economies
- Ethnic divisions (often colonial creations)
- Debt
- External dependency

**Challenge:** Build nations from colonies.

### Post-Colonial State Formation

**Challenges:**

**1. Arbitrary Borders:**
- Drew lines on maps
- Split ethnic groups
- Combined rival groups
- No "natural" boundaries

**2. Weak Institutions:**
- Colonial states extractive, not developmental
- Little bureaucracy
- Military > civilian rule
- Corruption

**3. Economic Dependency:**
- Export primary commodities
- Import manufactured goods
- Debt to former colonizers
- "Neocolonialism"

**4. Ethnic Diversity:**
- Multiple languages, religions, cultures
- Colonial "divide and rule" exacerbated
- No shared national identity
- Ethnic politics

**5. External Interference:**
- Cold War proxy wars
- IMF/World Bank structural adjustment
- Former colonizers maintain influence
- "Sovereignty" limited

### Nation-Building Projects

**How Create Unity?**

**Official Nationalism:**
- National language (often colonial language)
- National symbols, anthem
- State-controlled education
- National holidays

**Examples:**

> **Tanzania (Nyerere's Ujamaa)**
>
> - Swahili as national language (indigenous lingua franca)
> - "African Socialism"
> - Villagization (resettle population)
> - Single-party state
> - Relatively successful nation-building
> - But authoritarian, forced resettlement

> **Indonesia**
>
> - "Unity in Diversity" (Bhinneka Tunggal Ika)
> - Bahasa Indonesia
> - Pancasila ideology
> - Suppress regional identities
> - East Timor violence (independence 2002)
> - Papua ongoing

> **India**
>
> - Linguistic states (reorganized 1950s-60s)
> - Secular state (amid Hindu majority)
> - Democracy (largest in world)
> - But communal violence
> - Kashmir conflict

**Trade-offs:**
- Unity vs. diversity
- Order vs. freedom
- Development vs. democracy

## Weak States and State Failure

### What Makes States "Weak"?

**Max Weber:** State = monopoly on legitimate use of force in territory.

**Weak States:**
- Can't control territory
- Lack bureaucracy
- Can't tax effectively
- Corruption, patronage
- Limited legitimacy

**Examples:**
- Somalia (1990s-present—state collapse)
- Democratic Republic of Congo
- Afghanistan
- Haiti

### State Failure

**"Failed States":**
- Government loses control
- Warlords, militias
- Humanitarian crisis
- Refugee flows

**Debate:**

**Are States "Failing" or "Failed"?**
- Implies states should look like Western states
- Eurocentric standard
- Ignores agency, alternative forms

**Alternative View:**
- People navigate state weakness
- Informal governance
- Not absence of order—different order
- "Governance without government"

**Anthropologists (Carolyn Nordstrom, Janet Roitman):**
- Study how people survive state collapse
- Informal economies
- Cross-border networks
- Shadow states

### Anthropology of the State

**Not Just Institutions:**
- State is cultural idea
- Performed, imagined
- Symbols, rituals

**Timothy Mitchell, "Society, Economy, and the State Effect":**
- State = effect of practices
- Not coherent entity
- Boundary between state/society is constructed

**Akhil Gupta, "Blurred Boundaries":**
- India—state and society interpenetrate
- Corruption blurs boundaries
- Everyday state-society interaction

**James Ferguson, "The Anti-Politics Machine":**
- Lesotho development projects
- State exercises power through "development"
- Depoliticizes issues
- Extends bureaucratic power

**Aradhana Sharma and Akhil Gupta:** State ethnographies—study bureaucrats, documents, rituals, how state produced.

## Civil Society and Social Movements

### What Is Civil Society?

**Definition:**
- Sphere between state and family
- NGOs, associations, media
- Public sphere
- Democracy

**Habermas:** Public sphere where citizens deliberate.

**Post-Colonial Context:**
- NGOs proliferate (1980s-90s)
- Neoliberal turn (shrink state, grow NGOs)
- "Grassroots" development

### NGOs and Development

**Explosion of NGOs:**
- Fill gaps left by weak states
- Health, education, microfinance
- Democracy promotion
- Human rights

**Critiques:**

**1. Neoliberal Governmentality (Li, Ferguson):**
- Replace state functions
- Privatize welfare
- "Technical" not political solutions
- Depoliticize

**2. Accountability:**
- To donors, not communities
- Northern NGOs in Global South
- Perpetuate dependency

**3. "NGO-ization" (Alvarez):**
- Professionalize activism
- Bureaucratize movements
- Co-opt resistance

**But Also:**
- Provide needed services
- Empower communities (sometimes)
- Pressure governments

**Anthropologists Study:**
- Ethnographies of NGOs
- How actually operate
- Effects on communities
- Relations with states, donors

> **Example: Faye Ginsburg, "Rescuing the Nation"**
>
> - Pro-life and pro-choice activists (US)
> - Both claim "grassroots" civil society
> - Competing visions of nation
> - Civil society not singular

### Social Movements

**Contemporary:**
- Environmental (climate justice)
- Indigenous rights
- Women's rights
- LGBTQ+ rights
- Anti-austerity
- Democracy movements

**Anthropology:**
- Ethnographies of movements
- How mobilize?
- Meanings, identities, cultures
- Transnational connections

> **Example: Zapatistas**
>
> - 1994 uprising, Chiapas, Mexico
> - Indigenous autonomy
> - Anti-neoliberalism
> - Horizontal organizing
> - Global solidarity
> - "Alter-globalization"

> **Example: Arab Spring (2010-11)**
>
> - Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Bahrain, Yemen
> - Youth-led
> - Social media
> - Overthrow autocrats (some)
> - Varied outcomes
>
> **Anthropology:**
> - Lila Abu-Lughod, Paul Amar—Tahrir Square
> - Revolution as process
> - Gender dynamics
> - Disappointment, ongoing struggle

## Human Rights: Universal or Cultural?

### Human Rights Discourse

**Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948):**
- UN
- Individual rights
- Civil, political, economic, social rights
- "Universal"

**Expansion:**
- Women's rights (CEDAW)
- Children's rights
- Indigenous rights
- Disability rights
- LGBTQ+ rights (emerging)

**Human Rights as Global Language:**
- Activists deploy
- NGOs monitor
- States held accountable (theoretically)

### Anthropological Critiques

**1. Universalism vs. Cultural Relativism:**
- Are rights truly universal?
- Or Western imposition?
- Cultural variation in rights conceptions

**American Anthropological Association (1947):**
- Criticized UDHR as Western-centric
- Ignored non-Western values
- Culturally relative

**Rebuttal:**
- Cultural relativism can justify oppression
- Female genital cutting, honor killing
- Need universal standards

**Current Consensus:**
- Rights can be universal AND culturally inflected
- Implementation varies
- Dialogue, not imposition

**2. Individualism:**
- Human rights focus on individual
- Many cultures emphasize community, family
- Tension

**3. Neocolonialism:**
- "Human rights" used to justify intervention
- NATO bombing Yugoslavia (1999)
- Iraq War justified partly on human rights
- "Humanitarian imperialism"

**Makau Mutua:** Human rights as "cultural crusade"—West "saves" non-West.

### Rights in Practice

**Anthropology Studies:**
- How rights translate locally
- "Vernacularization" (Sally Engle Merry)
- Rights appropriated, transformed

**Examples:**

> **Women's Rights (CEDAW):**
>
> - Convention on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women
> - NGOs promote locally
> - Translated into local terms
> - Sometimes conflict with local norms
> - Negotiation, not simple imposition

> **Indigenous Rights:**
>
> - Free, prior, informed consent
> - Land rights
> - Cultural rights
> - Appropriated by indigenous movements
> - Strategic essentialism

**Sally Engle Merry, "Human Rights and Gender Violence":**
- How global norms become local
- Cultural translation
- Activists as mediators

## Refugees, Displacement, and Borders

### Global Refugee Crisis

**Numbers:**
- 100+ million forcibly displaced (2023)
- Refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs (internally displaced)
- Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar, Ukraine, etc.

**UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency):**
- Refugee = flees persecution
- Asylum seeker = claims refugee status
- IDP = displaced within country

### Causes of Displacement

**War and Conflict:**
- Civil wars (Syria, Yemen)
- Ethnic violence (Myanmar Rohingya)
- State violence

**Persecution:**
- Political, religious, ethnic
- LGBTQ+ persecution

**Environmental:**
- Climate change (droughts, floods)
- Not recognized as refugees (yet)

**Economic:**
- Poverty, inequality
- Not "refugees" officially
- But mixed with other causes

### Life in Refugee Camps

**Anthropological Ethnographies:**

> **Liisa Malkki, "Purity and Exile" (1995)**
>
> - Hutu refugees, Tanzania
> - Refugee camps
> - Mythico-history (narratives of nation)
> - Identity in exile
> - "National order of things" disrupted

> **Miriam Ticktin, "Casualties of Care" (2011)**
>
> - Undocumented migrants, France
> - Humanitarian reason
> - Illness as grounds for stay
> - Biological citizenship
> - Care and violence

**Camp Life:**
- Temporary but decades-long
- Limbo (legal, social)
- Dependence on aid
- Limited freedom
- But also: agency, community, resistance

**Agamben's "Bare Life":**
- Refugees as "bare life" (stripped of rights)
- Camps as "states of exception"
- Biopolitics

**But Anthropologists Show:**
- Refugees have agency
- Create communities
- Navigate systems
- Not just victims

### Borders and Sovereignty

**Borders:**
- Modern invention
- Fixed lines
- Control movement
- Sovereignty enacted

**But:**
- Porous (people cross)
- Enforced unevenly
- Violence at borders

**Reece Jones, "Violent Borders":**
- Border enforcement kills
- Walls, fences, patrols
- Mediterranean, US-Mexico
- Thousands die

**De León, "The Land of Open Graves":**
- US-Mexico border
- Migrants die in desert
- "Prevention through deterrence"
- Forensic anthropology
- Identify remains

**Borders as Performance:**
- Not just lines
- Checkpoints, walls, patrols
- Sovereignty performed

**Didier Fassin:**
- Moral economies of borders
- Humanitarian reason
- Who deserves entry?
- Suffering as currency

- Mozambique civil war
- Women's experiences
- Everyday violence
- Survival strategies

**Nancy Scheper-Hughes, "Death Without Weeping":**
- Brazil shantytown
- Everyday violence (poverty, police)

## Peacemaking and Reconciliation

### Post-Conflict Societies

**How Rebuild After Violence?**

**Truth and Reconciliation:**
- South Africa (post-apartheid)
- Testimony, acknowledgment
- Amnesty for truth
- Restorative justice

**Critiques:**
- Justice vs. reconciliation tension
- Victims pressured to forgive
- Perpetrators escape punishment
- Structural issues unaddressed

**International Criminal Court:**
- Prosecute genocide, war crimes
- Accountability
- But: selective enforcement, Western-dominated

**Anthropology:**
- Study how reconciliation works locally
- Cultural models of justice
- Not one-size-fits-all

> **Gacaca Courts (Rwanda)**
>
> - Community justice
> - Lower-level genocide perpetrators
> - Confess, community judges
> - Reintegrate
>
> **Debate:**
> - Culturally appropriate or coerced?
> - Justice or forgiveness?
> - Anthropologists divided

**Reintegration:**
- Ex-combatants
- Child soldiers
- Trauma, healing
- Economic opportunities

**Memory and Memorialization:**
- Museums, monuments
- "Never again"
- Collective memory

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are post-colonial states inherently weak, or is "weakness" a Eurocentric judgment?

**Question 2:** Can human rights be universal given cultural diversity?

**Question 3:** Do borders protect or harm humanity?

**Question 4:** Is violence ever justifiable politically?

**Question 5:** Can societies truly reconcile after genocide and mass violence?

## For Further Exploration

**Foundations:**
- Political Organization ([[../foundations/political_organization_types.md]])
- Resistance ([[../foundations/resistance_and_agency.md]])

**Contemporary:**
- Nationalism ([[nationalism_and_ethnicity.md]])

**Essential Readings:**
- Malkki, Liisa. (1995). *Purity and Exile*
- Ticktin, Miriam. (2011). *Casualties of Care*
- Nordstrom, Carolyn. (1997). *A Different Kind of War Story*
- Scheper-Hughes, Nancy. (1992). *Death Without Weeping*

**Remember:** Post-colonial states inherited arbitrary borders, weak institutions, economic dependency—making nation-building challenging. Civil society and NGOs proliferate but can depoliticize issues. Human rights are contested—universal aspirations meet cultural diversity. Refugees and displaced people number over 100 million, living in limbo, facing violent borders. Political violence takes many forms, from war to structural violence embedded in inequality. Anthropology reveals violence's meanings, refugees' agency, states' cultural production, human rights' vernacularization. Understanding contemporary politics requires recognizing colonial legacies, ongoing inequalities, and people's creative navigation of power.
