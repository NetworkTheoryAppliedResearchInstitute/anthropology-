# Material Culture, Art, and Aesthetics: Objects and Meaning

---

## Material Culture: More Than "Stuff"

**Material Culture:**
- Physical objects humans create, use
- Tools, art, buildings, clothing, everything
- Embody meanings, values, relationships
- Shape social life

**Not Passive:**
- Objects act on us
- Organize space, time, relationships
- Communicate, remember, connect

**Anthropology Studies:**
- How objects meaningful
- Social lives of things
- Consumption, production, exchange
- Aesthetics, value, identity

---

## The Social Life of Things

### Arjun Appadurai: "The Social Life of Things" (1986)

**Key Insight:**
- Things have biographies
- Meanings change over time
- Context-dependent

**Commodity Phase:**
- Object made for exchange
- Market value
- Alienable

**Gift Phase:**
- Given, creates relationship
- Inalienable
- Personal

**Heirloom Phase:**
- Passed down generations
- Family history
- Priceless (sentimental)

**Example:**
- Wedding ring
- Bought (commodity)
- Given (gift)
- Inherited (heirloom)
- Meanings transform

**Regimes of Value:**
- Different spheres
- Kula valuables ≠ commodities
- Crossing boundaries = political

**Diversion:**
- Moving things between spheres
- Profit, power
- Example: Indigenous art → art market

### Igor Kopytoff: "The Cultural Biography of Things"

**Ask Objects:**
- Where made?
- By whom?
- Who owned?
- How used?
- How meanings changed?
- What would ideal life course be?

**Commoditization:**
- Process, not state
- Things move in/out commodity status
- Culturally specific

**Singularization:**
- Remove from commodity
- Make unique, special
- Example: vintage car (mass-produced → singular)

**Example: Suitcase**
- Factory (commodity)
- Purchase (your suitcase)
- Travel companion (personal, stories)
- Vintage (collectible)
- Museum (history)

## Consumption and Identity

### Material Culture as Communication

**Objects Say Things:**
- Who we are
- What we value
- Social position
- Aspirations

**Grant McCracken, "Culture and Consumption":**

**Meaning Transfer:**
- Culturally constituted world → goods → consumer
- Advertising, fashion link goods to meanings
- Consumers use goods to construct identity

**Grooming Rituals:**
- Dressing, makeup
- Transfer meaning from goods to self
- Daily identity construction

### Daniel Miller: "Material Culture and Mass Consumption" (1987)

**Consumption = Creative:**
- Not passive
- People actively appropriate
- Make things meaningful

**"Stuff" (2010):**
- Ethnography of London street
- People's relationships with possessions
- Clutter, comfort, identity
- Objects = relationships

**Example: Sari**
- Indian saris
- How worn, stored, displayed
- Family, identity, aesthetics
- Material = social

**Not Just Materialism:**
- Objects mediate relationships
- Connect to others
- Memory, care

## Alfred Gell: Art and Agency (1998)

### Art as Social Agent

**Gell's Argument:**
- Art objects have agency
- Do things, affect people
- Not just representation

**Agency:**
- Capacity to act, affect
- Artworks = social actors
- Distributed personhood

**Index:**
- Artwork = index of agency
- Artist's skill evident
- Captivates observer

**Example: Marquesan Tattoos**
- Intricate designs
- Trap eye, mesmerize
- "How did they do that?"
- Agency through technical virtuosity

**Enchantment:**
- Art enchants
- Technology of enchantment
- Captivation

**Not About Beauty:**
- Function, agency, effects
- Social efficacy
- Cross-cultural

**Critique:**
- Downplays aesthetics, meaning
- Too functional
- But: influential, objects as actors

### Networks and Distributed Personhood

**Art Nexus:**
- Artist
- Prototype (inspiration)
- Index (artwork)
- Recipient (viewer)

**Distributed Person:**
- Person extends into objects
- Objects embody agency
- Example: ancestor statue (is ancestor)

---

## Aesthetics Across Cultures

### Defining Aesthetics

**Western Aesthetics:**
- Kant: disinterested contemplation
- Art for art's sake
- Beauty = universal?

**Anthropological Challenge:**
- "Art" Western category?
- Aesthetics everywhere
- But different forms, values

**Franz Boas:**
- All humans have aesthetic sense
- Different expressions
- Symmetry, skill valued

### Susan Vogel: African Aesthetics

**"African Aesthetics" (1986):**

**Not One "African Aesthetic":**
- Diversity
- Regional, ethnic variation

**Common Values:**
- Skill, virtuosity
- Smoothness, finish
- Symmetry, balance
- Appropriateness (context)
- Power (efficacy)

**Not Western "Beauty":**
- Not decorative
- Functional, powerful
- Moral, social

**Example: Yoruba Sculpture**
- **Ifarabale**: composure, coolness
- Calm, balance
- Smooth surface
- Not emotional expression
- Control

### Kathy M'Closkey: Navajo Weaving

**Navajo Rugs:**
- Women weavers
- Designs, colors
- Aesthetic criteria

**Hózhǫ́ (Balance, Beauty):**
- Not just visual
- Spiritual, moral
- Process matters (how woven)
- Harmony

**Commercialization:**
- Traders influenced designs
- "Authentic Navajo" marketed
- Weavers navigate tradition/market

---

## Robert Layton: "The Anthropology of Art" (1991)

### Cross-Cultural Aesthetics

**Universal Elements?**
- Symmetry appreciated
- Skill valued
- Pattern recognition

**But:**
- Meanings culturally specific
- Functions vary
- Can't impose Western categories

**Four Approaches:**

**1. Formalist:**
- Focus on forms, patterns
- Universal aesthetics?
- Ignores context

**2. Semiotic:**
- Art as symbol system
- Communication
- Meanings decoded

**3. Functionalist:**
- Art serves social functions
- Ritual, status, identity
- Durkheim, Malinowski

**4. Structural:**
- Underlying structures
- Binary oppositions
- Lévi-Strauss

**Layton's Synthesis:**
- All contribute
- Context matters
- Combine approaches

## Performance Art and Body Art

### Body as Canvas

**Tattooing:**
- Polynesian (extensive)
- Japanese (yakuza)
- Western (modern growth)
- Identity, belonging, aesthetics

**Alfred Gell, "Wrapping in Images":**
- Polynesian tattoos
- Wrap body in skin (social skin)
- Protection, power
- Agency

**Scarification:**
- African (Nuer, Dinka, Yoruba)
- Marks identity, status
- Beauty, initiation
- Embodied aesthetics

**Piercing, Modification:**
- Widespread
- Contemporary Western body modification
- Identity, rebellion, aesthetics

### Performance

**Abramović, Burden (Contemporary):**
- Body as medium
- Endurance, risk
- Blur art/life

**But Globally:**
- All cultures have body performance
- Dance, ritual
- Embodied aesthetics

## Architecture and Space

### Built Environment

**Buildings Shape Social Life:**
- Organize movement
- Include/exclude
- Symbolize values

**Pierre Bourdieu, "Kabyle House":**

**Berber House (Algeria):**
- Spatial organization

- Oppositions embodied
- Cosmology in architecture

**Inside/Outside:**
- Female/male
- Dark/light
- Wet/dry
- Oppositions structure space

**Habitus:**
- Embodied through house
- Learn gender walking through

### Suzanne Preston Blier: African Architecture

**"The Anatomy of Architecture" (1987):**

**Batammaliba (Togo/Benin):**
- Houses = bodies
- Anthropomorphic
- "House = person"
- Birth, death, life cycle

**Architecture = Cosmology:**
- Buildings encode meanings
- Social, spiritual
- Not just shelter

---

## Museums and Representation

### Who Owns Culture?

**Museums:**
- Collect, display
- Claim to preserve
- But: colonial origins

**James Clifford, "The Predicament of Culture":**

**Museum as Contact Zone:**
- Encounter, conflict
- Whose voice?
- Power in representation

**Repatriation Debates:**
- Indigenous demand return
- Sacred objects, remains
- Museums resist
- NAGPRA (US law, 1990)

**Example: Benin Bronzes:**
- Looted 1897 (British)
- Museums worldwide
- Nigeria demands return
- Ongoing

### New Museology

**Community-Controlled:**
- Indigenous museums
- Collaborative curation
- Multiple voices

**Example: Museum of Anthropology (Vancouver):**
- First Nations partnerships
- Visible storage
- Community access

## Photography and Representation

### Camera as Ethnographic Tool

**Visual Anthropology:**
- Photography, film
- Document, analyze

**But Power:**
- Who photographs whom?
- Colonial gaze
- Objectification

**Margaret Mead & Gregory Bateson, "Balinese Character" (1942):**
- Thousands of photos
- Systematic documentation
- But: framing, selection

**Elizabeth Edwards:**
- Photographs = objects
- Material, social lives
- Circulate, meanings change

### Deborah Poole: "Vision, Race, and Modernity"

**Andean Image Economy:**
- Photographs of indigenous people
- 19th-20th century
- Circulated globally
- Constructed "Indian"
- Race, modernity, power

**Not Neutral:**
- Photography = power
- Colonial science
- Racial typologies

---

## Fashion and Dress

### Clothing as Communication

**Joanne Eicher:**
- Dress = communication system
- Body modifications, supplements
- Conveys identity, status

**Examples:**

**Sari (India):**
- Region, caste, occasion

- Elegance, tradition

**Kimono (Japan):**
- Formality levels
- Age, season, occasion

- Textiles = wealth
- Precolonial trade
- Status, power

**Rarity Creates Value:**
- Purple dye (Phoenicia)
- Silk (China)
- Cotton, linen
- Control = power

---

## Contemporary Consumption

### Commodification

**Everything Commodified:**
- Art, culture, identity
- Neoliberal logic
- Brands, logos

**Naomi Klein, "No Logo":**
- Brands colonize culture
- Lifestyle marketing
- Resistance (culture jamming)

### Ethical Consumption

**Fair Trade:**
- Direct trade, fair prices
- Alternative to exploitation
- But: small scale, limits

**Slow Fashion:**
- Resist fast fashion
- Sustainability
- Quality, longevity

**Critiques:**
- Elitist (expensive)
- Individual not structural
- But: awareness growing

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Do objects have agency, or is that metaphorical?

**Question 2:** Can aesthetics be universal, or always cultural?

**Question 3:** Should museums return colonial loot, or preserve "world heritage"?

**Question 4:** Is consumption inherently bad, or can it be meaningful?

**Question 5:** What objects matter most to you, and why?

**Remember:** Objects aren't passive stuff—they have social lives, carry meanings, shape relationships. Appadurai: things have biographies, meanings transform. Gell: art has agency, captivates, acts. Material culture communicates identity (Miller). Aesthetics are culturally diverse—Yoruba smoothness, Navajo hózhǫ́, different criteria. Bodies are canvases (tattoos, scarification). Architecture embodies cosmology. Museums are contact zones with colonial legacies. Photography wields power. Fashion communicates status, identity, rebellion. Consumption can be creative appropriation, not just passive. Understanding material culture reveals how humans use objects to create meaning, remember, connect, distinguish—the material is always social.
