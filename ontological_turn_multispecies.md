# Beyond the Human: Ontological Turn, Multispecies, and the Anthropocene (2000s-Present)

---

## Decentering the Human

21st-century anthropology has witnessed radical challenges to anthropocentrism (human-centeredness):

**Traditional Anthropology Assumed:**
- Humans are special, separate from nature
- Only humans have culture, agency, meaning
- Nature is backdrop for human action
- Other species, things, environments are objects, not subjects

**Contemporary Challenges Ask:**
- What if other beings have their own ways of being in the world (ontologies)?
- What if animals, plants, spirits, things have agency?
- What if we're in the Anthropocene—epoch defined by human transformation of Earth?
- What if we need to decenter humans to understand our entanglements?

These questions sparked **ontological turn**, **multispecies ethnography**, and **Anthropocene anthropology**—controversial but influential new directions.

## The Ontological Turn: Different Worlds, Not Just Worldviews

### What Is the Ontological Turn?

**Traditional Anthropology:**
- One world, multiple cultures
- Different worldviews/perspectives on shared reality
- Epistemology (ways of knowing) varies

**Ontological Turn:**
- Multiple worlds/realities
- Not just different perspectives but different ontologies (ways of being)
- Ontology (what exists) varies

**Radical Claim:** Indigenous peoples aren't just seeing same world differently—they may inhabit genuinely different worlds.

### Key Thinkers

**Eduardo Viveiros de Castro: Perspectivism**

**Brazilian anthropologist studying Amazonian peoples:**

**Amerindian Perspectivism:**

Different beings see the world from their perspectives:
- Jaguars see themselves as human
- They see humans as prey (animals)
- Blood appears as manioc beer to them
- What's food to us is mud to jaguars

**All beings:**
- Have consciousness, intentionality
- See selves as human/persons
- See others through species-specific bodily perspectives

> **Example: Jaguar Perspective**
>
> **Western view:** Jaguar is animal, different from humans
>
> **Perspectivism:** 
> - Jaguar experiences itself as human-like person
> - Has culture (from its perspective)
> - Sees its prey-catching as we see hunting
> - Sees its drinking blood as we see drinking beer
> - What differs isn't mind/culture but body/perspective

**Multinaturalism vs. Multiculturalism:**

**Western multiculturalism:**
- One nature, multiple cultures
- Different interpretations of shared natural world

**Amazonian multinaturalism:**
- One culture (everyone is person), multiple natures
- Different bodies create different perceptual worlds

**The Challenge:** This isn't metaphor or belief—it's ontology. Jaguars really ARE persons (in Amerindian ontology).

**Philippe Descola: Beyond Nature/Culture**

**French anthropologist, student of Lévi-Strauss:**

**Four Ontological Schemas:**

**1. Animism:**
- Humans and non-humans share interiority (spirit/mind)
- Differ in physicality (bodies)
- Example: Many indigenous societies

**2. Totemism:**
- Humans and specific animals share both interiority and physicality
- Clan and totem animal are same kind
- Example: Australian Aboriginal groups

**3. Analogism:**
- All beings differ in both interiority and physicality
- Connections through correspondence, analogy, hierarchy
- Example: Medieval Europe, China

**4. Naturalism:**
- Humans and non-humans share physicality (nature, biology)
- Humans unique in interiority (culture, mind, soul)
- Example: Western modernity

**The Point:** Naturalism (our ontology) is one possibility among many—not universal truth.

**Martin Holbraad and Morten Axel Pedersen:**

**"The Ontological Turn is a Red Herring" (but they pursue it anyway):**

**Argument:**
- Don't assume indigenous concepts are about same things
- Powder in Cuban divination isn't "symbolizes" power—it IS power (ontologically)
- Take indigenous concepts seriously as concepts, not just beliefs

**Method:** Conceptual surprise—let ethnography transform our analytical categories.

### Critiques of Ontological Turn

**1. Relativism Run Wild:**

**Critique:** If every group has different ontology, how do we communicate? How do we adjudicate truth claims?

If jaguars are persons in one ontology but animals in another, which is true?

**Response:** Ontologists say both can be true in their respective ontologies. Critics say this is incoherent.

**2. Obscurantism:**

**Critique:** Ontological turn uses jargon-heavy, obscure writing. Is this deep philosophy or pretentious obfuscation?

**3. Political Evasion:**

**Critique:** Focusing on ontology risks ignoring material inequality, colonialism, power.

Indigenous peoples face real political struggles (land rights, sovereignty, violence). Does ontology help or distract?

**Response:** Some ontologists argue it helps by taking indigenous claims seriously. Critics unconvinced.

**4. Neoromanticism:**

**Critique:** Idealizes indigenous peoples as mystically connected to nature/spirits.

Like noble savage, but ontological noble savage.

**5. Difficult Empirically:**

**Critique:** How do you study different ontologies when you're embedded in your own?

Can anthropologist truly access radically different ontology?

## Multispecies Ethnography: More-Than-Human Worlds

### The Approach:

**Take seriously:**
- Animals, plants, microbes, fungi as actors
- Interspecies relationships
- Co-constitution of humans and non-humans
- Ecologies, not just societies

**Not just studying human beliefs about animals—studying human-animal relationships as they actually unfold.**

### Key Figures and Works

**Donna Haraway: Companion Species**

**Influential feminist science studies scholar:**

> **"The Companion Species Manifesto" (2003):**
>
> Humans and dogs co-evolved:
> - Dogs shaped human evolution
> - Humans shaped dog evolution  
> - "Becoming with" each other
> - Neither exists without the other
> - Naturecultures (nature and culture inseparable)

**Later work:**
- Staying with trouble (not solving, but living with complexity)
- Tentacular thinking (interconnections)
- Chthulucene (not Anthropocene—emphasizing multispecies collaboration)

**Eben Kirksey and Stefan Helmreich: "The Emergence of Multispecies Ethnography"**

**Defined the field:**

**Multispecies ethnography studies:**
- Host-parasite relations
- Animals in captivity
- Animal labor
- Human-microbe interactions
- Invasive species
- Extinction
- Conservation

> **Examples:**
>
> **Bees:** Heather Paxson studied cheese-makers and microbes—both are agents in cheese-making
>
> **Elephants:** Natasha Fijn studied elephant-mahout relationships in India—co-labor
>
> **Fungi:** Anna Tsing studied matsutake mushrooms—entanglements of fungi, trees, pickers, global markets

**Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing: "The Mushroom at the End of the World"**

**Matsutake mushrooms:**

- Grow in disturbed forests
- Valued in Japan, picked globally
- Pickers include refugees, displaced peoples
- Mushrooms, trees, pickers, spores, capitalism entangled

**Not humans using mushrooms but:**
- Interspecies assemblages
- Precarious life (both mushrooms and pickers)
- Capitalism through nature
- Survival in ruins

**Eduardo Kohn: "How Forests Think"**

**Runa people (Ecuador) and forest beings:**

**Argued:**
- Forests have semiosis (sign-making)
- Not just humans create/interpret signs
- All life involves representation
- Anthropology beyond the human

> **Example: Monkeys and Jaguars:**
>
> - Monkeys read jaguar signs (tracks, sounds)
> - Jaguars read monkey signs (movements, calls)
> - Humans read both
> - Layered semiosis across species

**Extending anthropology to living beings generally, not just humans.**

**Critiques:**
- Is this anthropology or ecology?
- Can we really know what monkeys think?
- Does extending agency to everything dilute the concept?

### Themes in Multispecies Work

**1. Entanglement:**
Species don't exist independently—they co-constitute each other.

**2. Symbiosis:**
Life requires cooperation across species (microbiomes, pollination, etc.).

**3. Domestication:**
Mutual transformation of humans and domesticated species.

**4. Labor:**
Animals work (sled dogs, service animals, research subjects).

**5. Kinship:**
Interspecies families and relations (pets, livestock).

**6. Death and Extinction:**
- Mass extinction (sixth extinction)
- Mourning multispecies losses
- Extinction as violent death

## The Anthropocene: Humans as Geological Force

### What Is the Anthropocene?

**Proposed geological epoch:**
- Humans have transformed Earth systems
- Human activity visible in geological record
- Planet fundamentally changed by one species

**Evidence:**
- Climate change
- Mass extinction
- Plastic in oceans
- Nuclear fallout markers
- Transformed landscapes globally

**When did it begin?**
- Industrial Revolution (1800s)? 
- Post-WWII Great Acceleration (1950s)?
- Agriculture (10,000 years ago)?
- Debated

### Anthropology in/of the Anthropocene

**Questions:**
- How do we live in damaged Earth?
- How do we mourn and grieve ecological loss?
- What are multispecies responses to climate change?
- How do different cultures understand environmental change?
- What does justice mean in Anthropocene?

**Anna Tsing: Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet**

**How to live in ruins?**
- Capitalism has created ecological devastation
- But life persists in ruins
- Attend to survival, resilience, precarity
- Ghosts (what's lost) and monsters (what emerges)

**Anthropocene as Capitalocene:**

**Critique:** Not "humans" generally but **capitalism** drove planetary transformation.

- Blaming "humanity" obscures responsibility
- Colonial extraction, capitalism, industrialization
- Some humans more responsible than others

**Better term:** Capitalocene, Plantationocene

**Thom van Dooren: Extinction Studies**

**Mourning species loss:**

> **Vultures in India:**
>
> - Vultures died from veterinary drug in cattle
> - Rapid population collapse
> - Ecological and cultural consequences (Parsi sky burials impossible)
> - Extinction as violent death, not just biodiversity loss
> - Mourning and witness

**Deborah Bird Rose: "Wild Dog Dreaming"**

**Australian Aboriginal perspectives:**

- Dingoes as kin
- Country is living being
- Ecological crisis as death of Country
- Indigenous knowledges essential
- Multispecies justice

## Posthumanism and New Materialism

### Beyond Humanism:

**Humanism assumed:**
- Humans are special, exceptional
- Nature is separate, object
- Humans have agency, things don't

**Posthumanism questions:**
- Human exceptionalism
- Nature/culture divide
- Exclusive human agency

### New Materialism: Matter Has Agency

**Influenced by:**
- Bruno Latour (Actor-Network Theory)
- Karen Barad (agential realism)
- Jane Bennett (vibrant matter)

**Core idea:** Matter isn't passive—it acts, has agency, shapes outcomes.

> **Example: Jane Bennett, "Vibrant Matter":**
>
> 2003 North American blackout:
> - Not just human failure
> - Electricity grid, trees, squirrels, weather, policies entangled
> - Matter (electricity, copper, trees) had agency
> - Assemblage of human and non-human actors

**For Anthropology:**
- Things aren't just symbols
- Material objects act
- Bodies aren't just inscribed—they're active
- Environment shapes as much as humans

## Critical Perspectives

### 1. Indigenous Critique: We've Been Saying This

**Indigenous scholars:**
"We've always known we're related to animals, plants, land. Why does it take Western theory to recognize this?"

**Zoe Todd (Métis scholar):**
- Ontological turn claims to be radical
- But indigenous peoples always had these ontologies
- Western academy late to the party
- Need to credit indigenous knowledge

### 2. Does This Help Political Struggles?

**Question:** Do ontological turn and multispecies ethnography help indigenous land rights, climate justice, environmental struggles?

**Some say yes:** Takes indigenous claims seriously, challenges Western ontology

**Others say no:** Academic theory disconnected from activist work

### 3. Obscure Language

**Critique:** Much of this work is difficult to read, jargon-heavy.

Is complexity necessary or exclusionary?

### 4. Where's the Power Analysis?

**Critique:** Focus on ontology and interspecies relations risks ignoring:
- Capitalism
- Colonialism
- Inequality
- Violence

**Response:** Best work combines ontological insights with political economy.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Why These Approaches Matter Now:

**1. Climate Change:**
Forces us to think about human-environment entanglements.

**2. Mass Extinction:**
Requires mourning and attention to multispecies loss.

**3. Pandemics:**
COVID-19 showed viral agency, human-animal-environment connections.

**4. Biotechnology:**
GMOs, CRISPR, synthetic biology blur nature/culture.

**5. Indigenous Rights:**
Recognition of indigenous ontologies supports sovereignty claims.

**6. Environmental Justice:**
Multispecies perspective shows unequal distribution of environmental harms.

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can radically different ontologies (different worlds) truly exist, or is this romantic exaggeration?

**Question 2:** If we extend agency to animals, plants, things—does the concept of agency become meaningless?

**Question 3:** Does focusing on multispecies entanglements help or distract from human political struggles?

**Question 4:** Should we call it the Anthropocene (highlighting humans) or Capitalocene (highlighting capitalism)?

**Question 5:** How do you live ethically in a time of mass extinction and climate change?

**Remember:** These contemporary approaches challenge anthropocentrism and Western ontology, opening space for radically different ways of understanding human-environment-animal-thing relations. They're controversial—some find them liberating, others obscurantist or politically evasive. But they've permanently changed conversations about agency, nature, culture, and human exceptionalism. Contemporary anthropology grapples with: How do we live in the Anthropocene? How do we attend to multispecies entanglements? How do we take indigenous ontologies seriously? These aren't just academic questions—they're urgent political and ethical challenges for our damaged planet.
