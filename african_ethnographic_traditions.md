# African Ethnographic Traditions: Classic Studies and Foundational Work

---

## Africa: A Continent of Diversity

### Geographic and Cultural Scope

**Vastness:**
- 54 countries (most)
- 1.4+ billion people
- 2,000+ languages (linguistic diversity)
- Hundreds of ethnic groups

**Regions:**
- **North Africa:** Arab/Berber (Mediterranean, Saharan)
- **West Africa:** Coastal, Sahel (diverse kingdoms, trade)
- **Central Africa:** Congo Basin (rainforest)
- **East Africa:** Great Lakes, Horn (pastoralists, Swahili coast)
- **Southern Africa:** Kalahari, diverse (San, Bantu)

**Anthropological Significance:**
- Human origins (paleoanthropology)
- Cultural diversity
- Colonial encounter (British social anthropology developed here)
- Post-colonial transformations

---

## British Social Anthropology in Africa

### Colonial Context

**Functionalism:**
- Malinowski, Radcliffe-Brown (1920s-1960s)
- British colonies (funding, access)
- "Practical anthropology" (colonial administration)

**Problematic Legacy:**
- Served colonial interests (often)
- "Tribes" (administrative units, reified)
- Synchronic focus (ignored history, change)
- "Traditional" vs. "modern" dichotomy

**But Also:**
- Rich ethnography
- Theoretical innovations
- Some resistance (anti-colonial)

## The Nuer: E.E. Evans-Pritchard

### Segmentary Lineage System

**Context:**
- Southern Sudan (now South Sudan)
- Nilotic pastoralists
- Cattle herders

**Ethnography:**
- Evans-Pritchard (1930s-1940s)
- *The Nuer* (1940), *Kinship and Marriage Among the Nuer* (1951), *Nuer Religion* (1956)

**Social Organization:**

**Segmentary Lineage:**
- Unilineal descent (patrilineal)
- Nested segments (genealogical levels)
- No centralized authority (acephalous)

**Principle:**
- "I against my brother, my brother and I against our cousin, my cousin and I against the stranger"
- Relative opposition (context-dependent)

**Example:**
- Conflict within minimal lineage: Stays within
- Conflict between minimal lineages: Major lineage unites
- External threat: Entire clan/tribe unites

**Function:**
- Order without government (anarchic)
- Balanced opposition
- Fluid, flexible

**Critique:**
- Idealized (Evans-Pritchard admitted)
- Static (ignored colonial impact)
- Male-centered

---

## The Tallensi: Meyer Fortes

### Descent and Filiation

**Context:**
- Northern Ghana
- Farmers

**Ethnography:**
- Meyer Fortes (1930s-1940s)
- *The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi* (1945)
- *The Web of Kinship Among the Tallensi* (1949)

**Kinship:**
- Patrilineal descent
- Complementary filiation (mother's side matters too)
- Ancestor worship (central)

**Insight:**
- Descent ≠ only principle
- Ties to mother's kin (important)
- Ritual authority (elders, Earth shrines)

**Theoretical Contribution:**
- Descent theory (foundational)
- Alliance theory (later, Lévi-Strauss critique)

---

## The Azande: E.E. Evans-Pritchard

### Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic

**Context:**
- Central Africa (Sudan, DRC, CAR)

**Ethnography:**
- Evans-Pritchard (1920s-1930s)
- *Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande* (1937)

**Witchcraft:**
- Belief: Witchcraft substance (mangu) in body
- Inherited (patrilineal)
- Unconscious (witches don't know)
- Explains misfortune (why me, why now?)

**Oracles:**
- Poison oracle (benge): Chicken given poison, question asked
  - Lives or dies = answer
- Rubbing-board oracle
- Termite oracle

**Rationality:**
- **Key Insight:** Azande system = rational (internally coherent)
- Not "primitive" thinking
- Logical within framework
- Closed system (unfalsifiable, self-confirming)

**Example:**
- Oracle wrong? Poison bad, wrong question, broken taboo
- Not: Oracle doesn't work

**Theoretical Importance:**
- Challenged Western rationality (not universal)
- Emic understanding (insider logic)
- Influenced philosophy of science (Kuhn, paradigms)

---

## The Tiv: Paul and Laura Bohannan

### Exchange and Marriage

**Context:**
- Nigeria (Benue Valley)

**Ethnography:**
- Paul and Laura Bohannan (1950s)
- *Tiv Economy* (1968)

**Exchange Spheres:**
- Three separate spheres (goods ranked)
  1. Subsistence (food, tools, chickens)
  2. Prestige (cattle, slaves, ritual items)
  3. Rights in people (women, marriage)

**Rules:**
- Exchange within sphere: Acceptable
- Exchange between spheres: Conversion (morally complex)
  - Downward conversion: Shameful (prestige → subsistence)
  - Upward conversion: Rare, difficult (subsistence → prestige)

**Women:**
- Top sphere (most valuable)
- Marriage: Exchange of women (sister exchange ideal)
- Not commodity (but category matters)

**Insight:**
- Not all goods equivalent (contra Western economics)
- Moral dimensions of exchange
- Substantivist economics (Polanyi)

---

## The Ndembu: Victor Turner

### Ritual Process and Symbols

**Context:**
- Zambia
- Matrilineal

**Ethnography:**
- Victor Turner (1950s-1960s)
- *Schism and Continuity in an African Society* (1957)
- *The Forest of Symbols* (1967)
- *The Ritual Process* (1969)

**Ritual:**
- Ihamba ritual (affliction, curing)
- Initiation (boys, girls)

**Symbolism:**
- Multivocal symbols (multiple meanings)
- Example: Milk tree (*mudyi*)
  - White sap = milk, matriliny, motherhood
  - Also: purity, tradition

**Ritual Process:**

**Liminality:**
- Threshold stage (betwixt and between)
- Initiates: No status (not child, not adult)
- Communitas (equality, anti-structure)

**Phases:**
1. Separation (pre-liminal)
2. Transition (liminal)
3. Reincorporation (post-liminal)

**Influence:**
- Performance studies
- Rites of passage (van Gennep elaborated)

## The Kalahari San: Richard Lee

### Foragers and Egalitarianism

**Context:**
- Botswana, Namibia (Kalahari Desert)
- Foragers (hunter-gatherers)
- !Kung, Ju/'hoansi

**Ethnography:**
- Richard Lee (1960s-1990s)
- *The !Kung San* (1979)
- *The Dobe Ju/'hoansi* (1984, 2003)

**Subsistence:**
- Hunting (men): Gemsbok, kudu, smaller game
- Gathering (women): Mongongo nuts, fruits, roots
  - Gathering = 60-70% of diet
- Mobile (seasonal camps)

**Social Organization:**
- Egalitarian (minimal hierarchy)
- Sharing (strong norms)
  - Meat distribution (rules, kinship)
  - !Kung: "Insulting the meat" (prevent boasting)
- Band (20-50 people, fluid membership)

**Leveling Mechanisms:**
- Mockery (boasting punished)
- Gift-giving (reciprocal, binds)
- No accumulation

**Debates:**

**"Original Affluent Society" (Sahlins):**
- Foragers = leisured (work few hours)
- Wants limited, easily satisfied
- !Kung data supported (Lee)

**Critique:**
- Romanticization?
- Ignore contact, marginalization
- !Kung not isolated (trade with Bantu)

**Revisionist History:**
- James Denbow, Edwin Wilmsen:
  - !Kung = refugees (Bantu expansion)
  - Marginalized pastoralists (not pristine)
- Lee: Acknowledged contact, but maintained autonomy

---

## Yoruba: William Bascom, Karin Barber

### Urban Traditions and Arts

**Context:**
- Nigeria, Benin (West Africa)
- ~40 million speakers (Yoruba language)
- Urban (ancient cities: Ife, Benin, Oyo)

**Religion:**
- Orisha (deities, hundreds)
- Ifa divination (geomancy)
- Syncretism (Christianity, Islam)

**Arts:**
- Sculpture (bronze, terracotta)
- Beadwork, textiles
- Performance (Gelede masquerade)

**Ethnography:**

**Diaspora:**
- Transatlantic slave trade
- Yoruba religion → Americas
  - Santería (Cuba)
  - Candomblé (Brazil)
  - Vodou (Haiti, Yoruba elements)

---

## Buganda: Lloyd Fallers, Aidan Southall

### Kingdoms and Centralization

**Context:**
- Uganda (interlacustrine region)
- Bantu kingdom (pre-colonial)

**Political Organization:**
- Kabaka (king, divine)
- Hierarchy (chiefs, appointed)
- Centralized (contrast: segmentary lineages)

**Ethnography:**
- Lloyd Fallers (1950s): *Bantu Bureaucracy* (1965)
  - Colonial impact
  - Transformation of chiefship
- Aidan Southall: *Alur Society* (1956)
  - Segmentary state (intermediate)

**Theoretical:**
- African kingdoms (variety)
- State formation (indigenous)

---

## Swahili Coast: J.S. Trimingham, Linda Donley-Reid

### Trade, Islam, and Hybridity

**Context:**
- East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania coast)
- City-states (Mombasa, Lamu, Zanzibar, Kilwa)
- Indian Ocean trade (ancient)

**Culture:**
- Swahili language (Bantu + Arabic loanwords)
- Islam (12th C+)
- Merchant culture
- Stone towns (architecture)

**Hybridity:**
- African + Arab + Persian + Indian
- Cosmopolitan (not purely "African" or "Arab")

**Ethnography:**
- J.S. Trimingham (1960s): Islam in East Africa
- Linda Donley-Reid (1980s+): Material culture, domestic space

**Debates:**
- Origins (African or Arab?)
- Current consensus: African base, cosmopolitan influences

---

## Witchcraft and Modernity

### Continuing Themes

**Witchcraft Accusations:**
- Not "traditional" only
- Increase with modernity, capitalism
- Explains inequality (why rich? Witchcraft)

**Jean and John Comaroff:**
- South Africa (post-apartheid)
- "Occult economies" (witchcraft of accumulation)
- Ritual murder (body parts, wealth)

**Peter Geschiere:**
- Cameroon
- *The Modernity of Witchcraft* (1997)
- Witchcraft = modern (not residual tradition)
- Politics, business (witchcraft accusations)

**Insight:**
- Tradition/modernity dichotomy (false)
- Witchcraft adapts, persists

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Why did British anthropology develop so much theory from African ethnography?

**Question 2:** Are segmentary lineage systems truly "stateless," or do they have government?

**Question 3:** Is the Azande witchcraft system rational?

**Question 4:** Were the !Kung the "original affluent society" or marginalized refugees?

**Question 5:** Why does witchcraft persist and even intensify with modernization?
