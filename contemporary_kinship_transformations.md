# Contemporary Kinship Transformations: New Forms and Futures

---

## Kinship in Flux

Traditional kinship studies focused on "exotic" non-Western systems. But **kinship in the West and globally is transforming rapidly:**

- New reproductive technologies (IVF, surrogacy, gamete donation)
- Same-sex marriage and queer families
- Transnational migration and global households
- Declining marriage rates, rising cohabitation
- Blended families, chosen families
- Digital kinship connections

**Anthropology asks:** How do these challenge and reconfigure kinship? What counts as "real" kinship?

**Shows:** Kinship isn't disappearing—it's adapting, multiplying, becoming more complex.

## New Reproductive Technologies (NRTs)

### The Technologies

**Assisted Reproduction Includes:**

**IVF (In Vitro Fertilization):**
- Eggs fertilized outside body
- Implanted in uterus
- Can use own gametes or donated

**Egg Donation:**
- Another woman's eggs
- Fertilized with partner's sperm
- Gestational mother ≠ genetic mother

**Sperm Donation:**
- Anonymous or known donors
- Creates genetic father separate from social father

**Surrogacy:**
- **Traditional:** Surrogate's egg + intended father's sperm
- **Gestational:** Intended parents' embryo + surrogate carries
- Gestational mother ≠ genetic mother ≠ social mother

**Embryo Donation:**
- "Adopted" embryos from other couples

**Posthumous Reproduction:**
- Using frozen sperm/eggs after donor's death

### Multiplying Parents

**NRTs Create Possibility of Multiple "Parents":**

**Example Scenario:**
- Egg donor (genetic mother)
- Gestational surrogate (birth mother)
- Intended mother (social mother)
- Sperm donor (genetic father)
- Intended father (social father)

**Five potential parents for one child!**

**Question:** Who is the "real" mother/father?

### Cultural Responses

**Different Societies Emphasize:**

**Genetics (Blood):**
- Genetic connection = "real" parent
- Donor gametes create "real" kinship
- Euro-American tendency

**Gestation (Body):**
- Who carries/births = mother
- Surrogate is "real" mother
- Legal in some jurisdictions

**Intention (Will):**
- Who intended to parent = parents
- Social commitment matters most
- Contract-based kinship

**Nurture (Care):**
- Who raises child = real parent
- Day-to-day care creates kinship
- Adoption model

**Varies:**
Different individuals and cultures privilege different aspects.

> **Case: Baby M (1986)**
>
> US legal case:
> - Traditional surrogacy (surrogate's egg)
> - Surrogate (Mary Beth Whitehead) refused to relinquish baby
> - Intended parents sued
>
> **Court decision:** Initially awarded to intended parents (contract), but surrogate granted visitation (genetic + gestational connection recognized)
>
> **Showed:** Law struggles with multiple claims to parenthood.

### Anthropological Studies

**Marilyn Strathern, *After Nature* (1992):**

**Argued:** NRTs destabilize nature/culture distinction.
- Reproduction once "natural"
- Now culturally managed, chosen
- Fragments procreation (genetic/gestational/social)
- No longer clear what's "natural" kinship

**Sarah Franklin, *Embodied Progress* (2007):**

**Studied:** UK IVF patients

**Found:**
- "Desperation" for genetic children
- Willingness to undergo extreme procedures
- Genetic connection deeply valued (despite being "social construction")
- Shows cultural power of biology even as NRTs fragment it

**Charis Thompson, *Making Parents* (2005):**

**US fertility clinics:**
- Strategic naturalizing (make process seem natural)
- Strategic objectification (embryos as objects to manipulate)
- Coordination of multiple relations (doctors, donors, patients)
- Kinship made through medical choreography

### Gamete Donation and Kinship

**Sperm Donation:**

**Anonymous Donation:**
- Traditional model
- Donor unknown
- Child may never know genetic father

**Known Donors:**
- Friend, family member donates
- Relationship with child negotiated
- Complicated: Is donor "dad" or "uncle" or nothing?

**Donor-Conceived Children:**
- Some seek genetic father
- DNA registries (Donor Sibling Registry)
- Finding half-siblings
- Creating new kin networks

> **Example: Donor Sibling Networks**
>
> Children from same sperm donor find each other:
> - Dozens of half-siblings
> - Create Facebook groups
> - Reunions
> - New kinship form: genetic half-siblings who didn't grow up together
>
> **Questions:** Are they "real" siblings? Obligations?

**Egg Donation:**
- More complex (medical procedure for donor)
- Often compensated
- Recipient parents more likely to acknowledge genetic mother

### Surrogacy

**Commercial Surrogacy:**

**US, India (until 2016), Ukraine:**
- Gestational surrogacy industry
- Surrogates often lower-class/Global South
- Intended parents often wealthy/Global North

**Critiques:**
- Exploitation of women's bodies
- Commodification of reproduction
- Global inequality
- "Reproductive tourism"

**Defenses:**
- Provides income for surrogates
- Helps infertile couples
- Autonomous choice

**Anthropological Studies:**

**Amrita Pande, *Wombs in Labor* (2014):**
- Indian surrogates
- Complex motivations (money but also altruism)
- Agency despite structural constraints
- Not simply victims or empowered—both

**Elly Teman, *Birthing a Mother* (2010):**
- Israeli surrogates
- Create emotional distance from baby
- "Carrying for someone else"
- Kinship work to not bond

### Posthumous Reproduction

**Frozen Sperm/Eggs After Death:**

**Scenario:**
- Soldier dies, wife uses frozen sperm
- Child born years after father's death

**Legal Questions:**
- Is child legitimate heir?
- Social Security benefits?
- Father-child relationship?

**Kinship Questions:**
- Can dead person be parent?
- Intention before death?
- Temporal disruption (conceived after death)

## Queer Kinship and Chosen Families

### "Families We Choose" (Kath Weston, 1991)

**Study:** San Francisco LGBTQ+ community, 1980s

**Key Finding:** LGBTQ+ people create **chosen families** when rejected by biological families.

**Chosen Family:**
- Friends become "sisters," "brothers," "mothers"
- Provide emotional support, care, recognition
- Holiday gatherings, crisis support
- Sometimes formalized (e.g., legal guardianship)
- More stable than friendships, kin-like obligations

**Why Necessary:**

**Coming Out:**
- Risk of family rejection
- "You're no longer my son/daughter"
- Cut off from biological kin

**Chosen Family Provides:**
- Belonging, identity, recognition
- Survival (housing, income)
- Care (especially during AIDS crisis)
- Legitimacy (in absence of legal marriage)

**Challenges Biology:**
- Kinship not "natural" or biological
- Created through commitment and care
- "Blood is thicker than water" rejected

### Same-Sex Parenting

**Before Legal Marriage:**

**Challenging Kinship Assumptions:**
- Two mothers, two fathers
- How to name? ("Mom" and "Mommy," "Dad" and "Daddy")
- Legal vulnerability (only one parent recognized)

**Co-Parenting Agreements:**
- Legal contracts
- Defining roles
- Protecting non-biological parent's rights

**After Marriage Equality:**

**Legally Recognized (Many Countries):**
- Both parents can adopt
- Presumption of parenthood
- Inheritance, custody rights

**Kinship Practices:**

> **Example: Lesbian Couple With Children**
>
> - One partner gestates (biological mother)
> - Other partner adopts (legal mother)
> - Both are "mom"
> - Extended family: two sets of grandparents
> - Children have step-family complexity from start
>
> **Creates:** New kinship forms, terminological adaptations.

**Biological Asymmetry:**
- One parent genetic/gestational
- Other parent social only (unless co-adoption)
- Negotiate this difference

**Some Use NRTs:**
- Sperm donors (known or anonymous)
- Egg donors
- Surrogates
- Creates even more complex configurations

### Transgender Parenthood

**Additional Complexity:**

**Transmasculine People:**
- Gestating parent who is "dad" not "mom"
- Challenges assumptions (pregnant man)
- Terminology struggles

**Transfeminine People:**
- May have biological children from before transition
- Social role as "mother" but not gestational

**Shows:** Gender ≠ reproductive role ≠ kinship term

### Polyamory and Kinship

**Multiple Partner Relationships:**

**Configurations:**
- Triads, quads, networks
- "Kitchen table polyamory" (everyone knows each other)

**Parenting:**
- More than two adults co-parenting
- Multiple households
- Complex legal situations (only two legal parents)

**Kinship Questions:**
- How many "parents" can child have?
- What obligations for non-legal parents?
- How to structure care?

**Challenges:** Binary parent model (father + mother, or two parents).

## Transnational Families

### Migration and Dispersed Kinship

**Global Migration Creates:**
- Families spread across countries
- Transnational households
- Long-distance parenting
- Remittance economies

### Transnational Motherhood

**Rhacel Parreñas, *Servants of Globalization* (2001):**

**Filipina Domestic Workers:**
- Migrate to Hong Kong, Italy, US
- Leave children in Philippines
- Send remittances
- "Mothering from a distance"

**Emotional Costs:**
- Guilt, pain of separation
- Miss children's growing up
- Sacrifice for economic survival

**Technology:**
- Phone calls, video chat (Skype, WhatsApp)
- Maintain relationships digitally
- "Virtual intimacy"

**Care Chains:**
- Migrant mothers care for wealthy children abroad
- Leave own children to grandmothers/aunts
- Who cares for those caregivers?

**Global Inequality:**
- Rich countries import care labor
- Poor countries export mothers
- Children raised without mothers

### Remittances and Obligation

**Economic Flows:**
- Children/siblings abroad send money home
- Support parents, siblings, extended family
- Massive economic importance (10-15% GDP some countries)

**Kinship Obligations:**
- Duty to send money
- Pressure from family
- Can't refuse without consequences

**Tensions:**
- How much is enough?
- Migrants' own families vs. origin families
- Resentment (working for others' benefit)

**But Also:**
- Fulfills cultural values (respect for parents)
- Builds houses, pays education
- Maintains kin ties

### Chinese Transnational Families

**Nancy Foner, *Across Generations* (2009):**

**Chinese Immigrants in US:**
- Grandparents in China
- Parents in US
- Children born in US

**Strategies:**
- Bring grandparents to US to help with childcare
- Send children to China for extended visits
- Maintain ties through technology
- Remittances both directions

**Language and Culture:**
- Grandparents don't speak English
- Grandchildren don't speak Chinese
- Communication difficulties
- Cultural transmission challenges

**Second Generation:**
- "Astronaut kids" (left in home country while parents work abroad)
- "Parachute kids" (sent to US alone for education)
- Raised by kin, separated from parents

### Digital Kinship

**Technology Enables:**
- Daily video calls
- Sharing photos, videos instantly
- Virtual presence at events (stream graduations, birthdays)
- Grandparents reading bedtime stories via video

**Does It Work?**
- Maintains relationships that would otherwise fade
- But can't replace physical copresence
- "Together" but apart

**Questions:**
- Is video call "real" kinship interaction?
- Quality of digitally-mediated care?
- Inequality (who has access to technology?)

## Blended Families and Step-Relations

### Increasing Divorce and Remarriage

**Statistics:**
- ~40-50% marriages end in divorce (US/Europe)
- Many remarry
- Children in multiple households

**Creates:**
- Stepparents, step-siblings, half-siblings
- Complex custody arrangements
- Multiple parental figures

### Terminological Struggles

**English Lacks Terms:**
- "Step-" sounds negative (wicked stepmother)
- No term for ex-spouse's new partner
- No term for child's half-sibling's other parent

**People Improvise:**
- "My daughter's father's wife"
- "Bonus mom"
- "My kids' stepfather"

**Shows:** Language hasn't caught up with reality.

### Obligations and Boundaries

**Questions:**
- Do stepparents have obligations to stepchildren?
- Inheritance?
- Care in old age?
- Can stepparents discipline?

**Varies:**
- Some stepparents very involved
- Others distant
- Legal rights minimal

**Children Navigate:**
- Multiple parental figures
- Different rules in different households
- Loyalty conflicts

## Declining Marriage and Cohabitation

### Cohabitation Rising

**Many Countries (Especially Europe):**
- Couples live together without marriage
- Long-term, stable relationships
- Have children together

**Legal Recognition:**
- Common-law marriage (some jurisdictions)
- Civil partnerships
- Registered partnerships

**Questions:**
- Are they "really" family without marriage?
- Legal vulnerabilities
- Cultural acceptance varies

### Single Parents by Choice

**Women (Mostly) Choosing:**
- To have children without partners
- Using sperm donors
- Adoption

**Challenges:**
- "Father" absence or unknown
- Social stigma (decreasing)
- Economic challenges

**Support:**
- Extended family
- Chosen family
- Community networks

---

## Adoptive Kinship

### Types of Adoption

**Domestic Adoption:**
- Within country
- Often open (birth parents known)

**International Adoption:**
- Across borders
- Often closed
- Racial, cultural differences

**Kinship Adoption:**
- Grandparents adopt grandchildren
- Aunts/uncles adopt nieces/nephews
- Legal formalization of care

### Transracial Adoption

**White Parents, Children of Color:**

**Issues:**
- Racial identity formation
- Cultural connection
- Navigating racism
- "Colorblind" vs. racial awareness

**Debates:**
- Is it cultural erasure?
- Should prioritize same-race adoption?
- Practical: Not enough same-race adoptive families

**Adult Adoptees:**
- Some seek birth families
- "Homeland" tours
- Identity questions

### "As-If" Kinship

**Adoption as:**
- Biological kinship substitute
- "As-if" they were born to parents

**Problems:**
- Denies difference
- Secrets about origin
- Can't ask questions

**Shift Toward:**
- Open adoption
- Honoring dual heritage
- Birth parents + adoptive parents

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** With NRTs fragmenting parenthood, should we have more than two legal parents?

**Question 2:** Is chosen family as "real" as biological family? What makes kinship "real"?

**Question 3:** Do transnational families show kinship can function across distance, or that distance fundamentally changes kinship?

**Question 4:** Should commercial surrogacy be banned (exploitation) or allowed (autonomy)?

**Question 5:** Is kinship becoming more or less important in contemporary life?

**Remember:** Contemporary kinship isn't disappearing—it's proliferating. NRTs fragment biology into genetics, gestation, intention. Queer families prove kinship is social, chosen, care-based. Transnational families maintain ties across distance. Blended families create complex webs. All challenge traditional definitions. What's "real" kinship? Not biology alone. Not law alone. But commitment, care, mutual obligation, social recognition. Kinship adapts to new technologies, global migration, changing gender/sexuality norms, diverse family forms. The anthropological insight persists: kinship is culturally constructed, varies enormously, organizes social life. New forms don't destroy kinship—they expand and reconfigure it.
