# Early States and Urbanism: The Rise of Civilization

## What Is a State?

### Defining Complex Societies

**State Characteristics:**

**Political:**
- Centralized authority
- Hierarchical (rulers, bureaucracy, subjects)
- Territorial (defined boundaries)
- Monopoly on violence (military, police)
- Laws, courts

**Economic:**
- Taxation, tribute
- Redistribution
- Specialization (full-time specialists)
- Trade networks (long-distance)

**Social:**
- Class stratification
- Elites vs. commoners
- Inherited status
- Slavery (often)

**Ideological:**
- Legitimizing ideology
- State religion
- Monumental architecture
- Writing (often)

## Elman Service's Typology

### Bands, Tribes, Chiefdoms, States

**Band:**
- Small (25-100)
- Egalitarian
- Mobile hunter-gatherers
- No formal leaders

**Tribe:**
- Larger (hundreds)
- Egalitarian or ranked
- Horticultural or pastoral
- Big men (achieved status)
- Segmentary lineage

**Chiefdom:**
- Thousands
- **Ranked** (hereditary)
- Chief (central authority, limited)
- Redistribution
- No bureaucracy
- Polynesia example

**State:**
- Tens of thousands+
- **Stratified** (classes)
- Centralized government
- Bureaucracy
- Cities
- Writing (often)

**Critique:**
- Unilineal evolution (bands→states)
- Doesn't fit all cases
- Static categories
- But: useful heuristic

---

## Why Do States Form?

### Theories

### Hydraulic Hypothesis (Karl Wittfogel)

**Argument:**
- Irrigation required (arid zones)
- Large-scale coordination
- Centralized management
- Power concentrated → despotism

**Examples:**
- Mesopotamia (irrigation canals)
- Egypt (Nile flooding)
- China (Yellow River)

**Problems:**
- States without irrigation (Maya)
- Irrigation without states (Hohokam)
- Oversimplified

### Warfare and Circumscription (Robert Carneiro)

**Argument:**
- Environmental circumscription
- Limited agricultural land (mountains, ocean, desert)
- Population growth → competition
- Warfare
- Losers subjugated (can't flee)
- Conquest state

**Examples:**
- Coastal Peru (Pacific, desert, Andes)
- Nile Valley (desert boundaries)

**Extension:**
- Social circumscription (surrounded by other groups)

**Problems:**
- States without circumscription
- Warfare not always causal

### Trade and Exchange (William Rathje)

**Argument:**
- Resource imbalances
- Need for exotic goods (metal, stone)
- Control of trade routes
- Elites manage exchange
- Power from trade

**Examples:**
- Mesopotamia (no metal, stone)
- Maya lowlands (obsidian from highlands)

**Problems:**
- Trade ancient (predates states)
- Not sufficient explanation

### Managerial Benefits (Kent Flannery)

**Argument:**
- Benefits of coordination
- Conflict resolution
- Defense
- Information management
- People "buy in" (not coerced)

**Systemic Approach:**
- Positive feedback loops
- Complexity increases

**Problems:**
- Why surrender autonomy?
- Assumes rationality

### Multivariate (Most Accepted Today)

**Synthesis:**
- No single cause
- Different pathways
- Context-specific
- Population growth, warfare, trade, ideology, environment
- **All interact**

**Charles Stanish:**
- Competition
- Cooperation
- Both drive complexity

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Why did states form in some places and not others?

**Question 2:** Were early states beneficial or oppressive?

**Question 3:** Is collapse inevitable?

**Question 4:** Could we have civilization without states?

**Question 5:** Why did the Indus Valley civilization seem more egalitarian?

**Remember:** **State defined** centralized authority/hierarchy/territorial/monopoly violence/laws, taxation/redistribution/specialization/trade, class stratification elites vs. commoners, legitimizing ideology/religion/monuments/writing. **Service typology** bands (25-100 egalitarian mobile)/tribes (hundreds egalitarian/ranked big men)/chiefdoms (thousands RANKED hereditary chief redistribution Polynesia)/states (tens of thousands+ STRATIFIED classes bureaucracy cities writing often, critique unilineal evolution static but useful). **Theories state formation**: Hydraulic (Wittfogel irrigation coordination power despotism Mesopotamia/Egypt/China problems states without irrigation), Warfare/Circumscription (Carneiro environmental limited land competition conquest losers subjugated coastal Peru/Nile problems not always), Trade (Rathje resource imbalances control elites Mesopotamia/Maya problems trade predates states), Managerial (Flannery benefits coordination people buy in problems why surrender?), **Multivariate most accepted** (no single cause different pathways population/warfare/trade/ideology/environment interact Stanish competition/cooperation). **Childe's "Urban Revolution" criteria** (cities/specialization/taxation/monuments/ruling class/writing/science/art/trade/state NOT all necessary Inka no writing). **Urbanism** cities large dense public buildings walls specialized areas non-agricultural. **Mesopotamia first** (Uruk 4,000-3,100 BCE 50,000+ largest temples/Eanna/cylinder seals/**writing 3,300 BCE cuneiform**/specialization irrigation trade Uruk expansion colonies, later city-states Ur/Lagash competition Sargon Akkad 2,334 BCE first empire). **Egypt** (Nile predictable floods circumscribed desert unification 3,100 BCE Narmer/Menes Upper+Lower, Old Kingdom 2,686-2,181 BCE pyramids Giza divine kingship hieroglyphics Memphis less urbanized riverine). **Indus Valley** (2,600-1,900 BCE Harappa/Mohenjo-daro planned grid standardized bricks drainage Great Bath granaries trade crafts seals, **Indus script undeciphered**, EGALITARIAN? less inequality no palaces/royal burials, decline 1,900 BCE climate/river shifts). **China** (Erlitou 1,900-1,500 BCE palaces bronze Xia? legendary, Shang 1,600-1,046 BCE oracle bones divination/writing Anyang bronze vessels royal tombs human sacrifice chariots ancestor veneration legitimacy isolation independent). **Mesoamerica** (Olmec 1,200-400 BCE Gulf Coast "Mother Culture" San Lorenzo/La Venta colossal heads jade ball game symbolic system precursor Maya, later Teotihuacan 100 BCE-550 CE 100,000+/Maya 250-900 CE/Aztec 1300s-1521 CE). **Andes** (Caral 3,000-1,800 BCE Norte Chico coastal Peru pre-ceramic pyramids Shady earliest Americas? fishing/cotton trade, later Chavín/Moche/Nazca/Wari/Tiwanaku/Inka 1400s-1532 CE largest pre-Columbian). **Archaeological evidence**: Monumental architecture (display power organize labor corvée/slavery pyramids/ziggurats/palaces/walls), social stratification (burials elite rich vs. commoners simple/retainers/sacrifice, housing palace vs. huts, sumptuary exclusive), craft specialization (full-time attached/independent standardization workshops), **writing** (administrative record-keeping/ideological royal/religious, cuneiform 3,300 BCE/hieroglyphics 3,200 BCE/Indus undeciphered/Chinese oracle bones 1,200 BCE/Maya glyphs 250 BCE+, NOT universal Inka khipu knotted strings), warfare (fortifications/weapons/warrior burials/iconography/skeletal trauma standing armies conquest). **Collapse** (Maya 900 CE/Rome West 476 CE/Angkor 1400s, theories environmental degradation/overpopulation/warfare/economic/social inequality revolt/systems complexity unsustainable Tainter diminishing returns/multivariate cascading, NOT "end" reorganization continuity).
