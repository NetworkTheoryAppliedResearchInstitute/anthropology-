# Symbolic Behavior and Paleolithic Art: The Emergence of Culture

---

## What Is Symbolic Behavior?

### Beyond Function

**Definition:**
- Objects/actions with meaning beyond practical use
- Arbitrary associations
- Culturally learned
- Shared understanding

**Examples:**
- Art
- Ornamentation (beads, jewelry)
- Ritual, burials
- Music
- Notation, counting?

**Why Important:**
- Marks "modern" human cognition
- Language prerequisite? (symbolic thought)
- Cultural transmission
- Identity, social cohesion

**Debate:**
- When did it emerge?
- Gradual or sudden?
- Uniquely Homo sapiens, or Neanderthals too?

## Ochre Use

### Red Powder Everywhere

**What Is Ochre?**
- Iron oxide
- Red, yellow, brown
- Ground to powder

**Archaeological Evidence:**
- Very old (300,000+ years)
- Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens
- Widespread (Africa, Europe, Asia)

**Blombos Cave (South Africa, ~100,000-70,000 years ago):**
- Ochre processing toolkit
- Ground, mixed, stored
- Engraved ochre pieces (abstract patterns!)
- **Earliest symbolic behavior?**

**Christopher Henshilwood:**
- Excavator
- "Evidence of modern behavior"

**Functions Debated:**

**Practical:**
- Hide tanning
- Adhesive (mixed with resin)
- Sunscreen, insect repellent
- Medicine

**Symbolic:**
- Body paint
- Ritual
- Art

**Both?**
- Likely multi-functional
- But: elaboration suggests symbolic
- Engraved ochre (Blombos) NOT practical

## Personal Ornaments

### Beads and Identity

**Evidence:**

**Shell Beads:**
- Perforated (holes for stringing)
- Nassarius shells (snail)

**Skhul and Qafzeh (Israel, ~100,000 years ago):**
- Homo sapiens burials
- Shell beads

**Blombos Cave (South Africa, ~75,000 years ago):**
- Tick shell beads
- Deliberately perforated

**Grotte des Pigeons (Morocco, ~142,000 years ago):**
- Shell beads
- **Oldest known**

**Neanderthals:**
- Some ornaments
- Debated (pre-contact with modern humans or independent?)
- Eagle talons (Krapina, Croatia, ~130,000 years ago)
- Possible symbolism

**Function:**
- Personal adornment
- Identity (group membership)
- Status
- Exchange

**Implication:**
- Self-awareness
- Social identity
- Cultural marking

---

## Burials

### Treatment of the Dead

**Earliest:**
- Debated

**Neanderthals:**

**La Chapelle-aux-Saints (France, ~60,000 years ago):**
- Elderly Neanderthal
- Grave (deliberate?)
- Early claims exaggerated (not ritual, just burial)

**Shanidar Cave (Iraq, ~60,000 years ago):**
- Neanderthals
- Pollen (flowers?)
- Ralph Solecki claimed "flower burial"
- **Debunked** (rodent activity, not ritual)
- But: burial intentional

**La Ferrassie (France):**
- Multiple Neanderthal burials
- Possible grave goods (debated)

**Sima de los Huesos (Spain, ~430,000 years ago):**
- Homo heidelbergensis
- 28+ individuals
- Pit (intentional accumulation?)
- Red hand axe (symbolic?)
- Not burial in grave sense

**Homo Sapiens:**

**Qafzeh and Skhul (Israel, ~100,000 years ago):**
- Clear burials
- Grave goods (shell beads, ochre, antlers)
- Body positioning

**Implications:**
- Care for dead
- Belief in afterlife?
- Social bonds
- Ritual

## Cave Art

### Paleolithic Masterpieces

**Geography:**
- Europe (France, Spain mainly)
- Also: Africa, Australia, Asia (less studied)

**Age:**
- ~40,000-10,000 years ago (Europe, Upper Paleolithic)
- Some older (Africa, Southeast Asia)

**Major Sites:**

### Chauvet Cave (France, ~37,000-33,500 years ago)

- **Oldest in Europe**
- Sophisticated (not "primitive")
- Animals: horses, lions, rhinos, bison
- Shading, perspective
- Werner Herzog documentary "Cave of Forgotten Dreams"

### Lascaux (France, ~17,000 years ago)

- "Sistine Chapel of Prehistory"
- Bulls, horses, deer
- Discovered 1940 (teenagers)
- Closed (CO2, algae damage)
- Replica for tourists

### Altamira (Spain, ~36,000-13,000 years ago)

- Bison famous (polychrome)
- Ceiling
- Discovered 1879 (initially rejected as fake!)

### Techniques:

**Painting:**
- Pigments: ochre (red), manganese (black), charcoal
- Binders: animal fat, water
- Application: fingers, brushes (moss, fur), spray (blow through tube)

**Engraving:**
- Scratch with flint
- Outlines, details

**Bas-Relief:**
- Sculpt (clay, rock)
- Bison (Tuc d'Audoubert, France)

**Use of Natural Forms:**
- Rock contours suggest animal shapes
- 3D effect

**Subjects:**

**Animals:**
- Majority
- Bison, horses, aurochs, deer, ibex, mammoths
- Predators (lions, bears) less common
- **Not necessarily food animals**
- Few fish, birds

**Humans:**
- Rare
- Often partial (hands)
- Stick figures
- "Sorcerer" figures (animal-human hybrids)

**Abstract:**
- Dots, lines, grids
- Geometric patterns
- Hand stencils (blow pigment over hand)

**Interpretations:**

**Hunting Magic:**
- Early idea (Abbé Breuil)
- Paint animals → ensure success
- **Problem:** Animals depicted ≠ animals eaten

**Shamanism:**
- David Lewis-Williams, Jean Clottes
- Trance states
- Entoptic phenomena (geometric patterns from altered states)
- Deep caves (sensory deprivation)

**Structuralism:**
- André Leroi-Gourhan
- Patterns (male-female symbolism)
- Horse + bison pairs

**Totemism:**
- Clan animals

**Storytelling:**
- Narratives

**Art for Art's Sake:**
- Aesthetic pleasure

**Multiple Functions:**
- Probably no single explanation
- Context, location varied
- Ritual, social, aesthetic

**Deep Caves:**
- Dangerous access
- Total darkness (needed lamps)
- Effort suggests importance
- Not "galleries"
- Ritual spaces?

**Acoustics:**
- Some painted areas have resonance
- Singing, chanting?
- Iegor Reznikoff research

## Portable Art

### Mobiliary Art

**Venus Figurines:**

**Characteristics:**
- Female figures
- Exaggerated sexual features (breasts, hips, vulva)
- Minimized heads, feet
- Small (palm-sized)

**Examples:**
- Venus of Willendorf (Austria, ~25,000 years ago)
- Venus of Dolní Věstonice (Czech Republic, ~29,000 years ago)
- Venus of Brassempouy (France, ~25,000 years ago, rare face!)

**Age:**
- Gravettian culture (33,000-22,000 years ago)

**Interpretations:**

**Fertility Symbols:**
- Pregnancy, childbirth

**Mother Goddess:**
- Early religion (LeRoy McDermott argues self-portraits by pregnant women)

**Pornography:**
- Sexualized female bodies

**Idealized Beauty:**
- Cultural standards (plumpness = health, status)

**Educational:**
- Teaching about reproduction

**Critique:**
- "Venus" (named by 19th C men)
- Assumptions about gender

**Other Portable Art:**
- Animal carvings (ivory, bone)
- Decorated tools
- Spear throwers (atlatls) with carvings

## Music

### Archaeological Evidence

**Flutes:**

**Hohle Fels (Germany, ~40,000 years ago):**
- Bone flute (vulture wing)
- Five finger holes
- Playable (reconstructed, sounds!)

**Geißenklösterle (Germany, ~42,000 years ago):**
- Mammoth ivory flute

**Neanderthals?**
- Divje Babe (Slovenia, ~43,000 years ago)
- Cave bear femur with holes
- **Debated:** Flute or carnivore chew marks?
- Most skeptical

**Implications:**
- Music ancient
- Social bonding (Steven Mithen hypothesis: music before language)
- Ritual

**Other Sounds:**
- Percussion (lithophone: struck stones)
- Singing (no evidence, but likely)

---

## Notational Systems

### Counting and Calendars?

**Tallies:**
- Notched bones
- Ishango Bone (Congo, ~20,000 years ago)
  - Notches (groups)
  - Counting? Lunar calendar?
  - Debated

**Implications:**
- Abstract thought
- Numeracy

## Behavioral Modernity Debate

### When Did We Become "Us"?

**Positions:**

### "Human Revolution" Model

**Sudden Change:**
- ~50,000-40,000 years ago (Upper Paleolithic Europe)
- Art, symbols, technology explode
- Richard Klein, others

**Cause:**
- Genetic mutation (language gene?)
- Rewired brain

**Evidence:**
- European Upper Paleolithic dramatic

**Problems:**
- Africa shows earlier evidence (Blombos)
- Eurocentric

### Gradualist Model

**Slow Accumulation:**
- Starts earlier (100,000+ years ago Africa)
- In and out of cultural modernity
- Sally McBrearty, Alison Brooks

**Evidence:**
- Blombos ochre, beads (~75,000-100,000 years ago)
- African Middle Stone Age sophisticated

**Modern Behavior Package:**
- Symbolic behavior
- Blade technology
- Long-distance exchange
- Diverse toolkit
- Art, ornamentation

**Africa First:**
- Gradually accumulates
- Not sudden

### Neanderthal Capabilities

**Debate:**
- Neanderthals capable of symbolic thought?

**Evidence For:**
- Burials (care for dead)
- Ochre use
- Eagle talons (ornaments?)
- Some art? (disputed)
- Hybrid sites (mixed Neanderthal-modern human)

**Evidence Against:**
- Less elaborate than modern humans
- Possible imitation (learned from contact)

**Current View:**
- Some symbolic capacity
- But: less than modern humans?
- Differences in degree

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** When did humans become "behaviorally modern"?

**Question 2:** Did Neanderthals have symbolic thought and culture?

**Question 3:** What does cave art really mean?

**Question 4:** Are Venus figurines fertility symbols or something else?

**Question 5:** Is music older than language?

**Remember:** Symbolic behavior marks modern cognition—meaning beyond function arbitrary cultural. **Ochre** 300,000+ years Neanderthals/early sapiens (Blombos South Africa 100-70 kya processing engraved abstract patterns earliest symbolic Henshilwood, practical hide tanning vs. symbolic body paint ritual). **Beads** personal ornament identity (Grotte des Pigeons Morocco 142 kya oldest, Skhul/Qafzeh Israel 100 kya, Blombos 75 kya, Neanderthals some eagle talons Krapina 130 kya debated). **Burials** care for dead (Neanderthals Shanidar Iraq "flower burial" debunked rodents but intentional, La Chapelle/La Ferrassie, Homo sapiens Qafzeh/Skhul 100 kya grave goods beads/ochre/antlers afterlife). **Cave art** 40-10 kya Europe Upper Paleolithic (Chauvet 37-33 kya oldest sophisticated not primitive, Lascaux 17 kya "Sistine Chapel," Altamira 36-13 kya polychrome bison, techniques painting/engraving/bas-relief spray blow, subjects animals majority not food, humans rare hands, abstract dots/lines/grids, interpretations hunting magic debunked/shamanism Lewis-Williams trance/structuralism Leroi-Gourhan/totemism/storytelling/art for art's sake multiple functions, deep caves dangerous ritual acoustics resonance Reznikoff). **Portable art** Venus figurines (Willendorf/Dolní Věstonice/Brassempouy Gravettian 33-22 kya exaggerated sexual features, interpretations fertility/mother goddess/pornography/beauty/education/"Venus" 19th C men assumptions). **Rock art** global Africa/Australia 50 kya+ oldest?/Americas (dating difficult no organic, petroglyphs carved/pictographs painted). **Music** flutes (Hohle Fels Germany 40 kya bone playable, Geißenklösterle 42 kya mammoth ivory, Neanderthals Divje Babe debated carnivore chew marks?, Mithen music before language social bonding). **Notational** Ishango Bone Congo 20 kya notches counting lunar calendar debated. **Behavioral modernity debate**: "Human Revolution" model (Klein sudden 50-40 kya Upper Paleolithic Europe genetic mutation language Eurocentric problem) vs. **Gradualist** (McBrearty & Brooks Africa first Blombos 100-75 kya earlier slow accumulation in/out modernity, modern behavior package symbolic/blade/exchange/diverse toolkit/art). Neanderthal capabilities debated (burials/ochre/talons some vs. less elaborate imitation contact). Understanding symbolic behavior reveals when/how modern cognition emerged—Africa earlier gradual not sudden European "revolution," Neanderthals some capacity, art/music/ornament ancient human universal.
