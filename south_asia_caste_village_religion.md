## The Caste System

### Structure and Ideology

**Definition:**
- Hereditary social stratification (India)
- Birth determines position
- Endogamous (marry within caste)
- Occupational specialization (traditional)

**Varna (Four Categories):**
1. **Brahmins** (priests, scholars) - highest
2. **Kshatriyas** (warriors, rulers)
3. **Vaishyas** (merchants, farmers)
4. **Shudras** (laborers, servants) - lowest

**Outside Varna:**
- **Dalits** ("Untouchables," "Scheduled Castes")
  - Formerly "outcastes"
  - Polluting occupations (traditionally): Leather work, sanitation, corpse handling
  - Segregated (spatially, socially)
  - ~200 million (India)

**Jati (Actual Castes):**
- Thousands of local, occupational castes
- Varna = ideological framework
- Jati = lived reality (regional, specific)

**Purity and Pollution:**
- Ideology (ritual purity)
- Brahmins = most pure
- Dalits = most polluting
- Rules: Food exchange, touch, water sources
- Hierarchy maintained through pollution avoidance

---

## Classic Caste Studies

### Anthropological Debates

**Louis Dumont:**
- *Homo Hierarchicus* (1966, French; 1970, English)
- Argued: Caste = unique to India (Hindu ideology)
- Hierarchy = fundamental value (India)
  - Contrast: West (equality as value)
- Purity/pollution = organizing principle
- "Encompassment" (hierarchy encompasses all)

**Critiques:**
- Overgeneralized (India diverse)
- Brahmin-centric (elite perspective)
- Ignored change, resistance
- Ahistorical (presented as timeless)
- Ignored economics, politics (focused on ideology)

**M.N. Srinivas:**
- Indian sociologist/anthropologist
- *Religion and Society Among the Coorgs of South India* (1952)
- **"Sanskritization":**
  - Lower castes adopt Brahmin practices (mobility strategy)
  - Ritual status ≠ economic/political power (can diverge)
- **Dominant Caste:**
  - Locally powerful caste (not necessarily highest ritually)
  - Numbers, land ownership, political power

---

## Village Studies

### The "Indian Village"

**Importance:**
- Majority rural (historically, still significant)
- Village = unit of study (microcosm)

**Classic Studies:**

**Oscar Lewis:**
- *Village Life in Northern India* (1958)
- Rampur village (Uttar Pradesh)
- Detailed ethnography (daily life, caste, kinship, economy)

**McKim Marriott:**
- Kishan Garhi village (Uttar Pradesh, 1950s)
- Caste interactions (jajmani system)
- "Universalization and Parochialization" (ritual diffusion)

**Adrian Mayer:**
- *Caste and Kinship in Central India* (1960)
- Faction (political groupings, cut across caste sometimes)

---

## Jajmani System

### Economic and Ritual Exchange

**Definition:**
- Hereditary patron-client relationships (villages)
- Upper castes (patrons, *jajman*) ↔ Service castes (clients, *kamin*)

**Example:**
- Brahmin priest serves landowner family
- Barber serves multiple households
- Potter provides pots
- Washerman washes clothes

**Exchange:**
- Services (ritual, practical)
- Paid in grain (harvest share), not cash (traditionally)
- Hereditary (son inherits father's patrons)

**Debates:**

**Functionalist View:**
- Interdependence (mutual)
- Integration (village unity)

**Marxist/Critical View:**
- Exploitation (unequal power)
- Caste = class (disguised)
- Ideological mystification (hierarchy justified)

**Decline:**
- Monetization (cash payments)
- Urbanization (migration)
- Modernization (caste less occupationally rigid)
- But: Caste persists (socially, politically)

---

## Kinship in South Asia

### Complexity

**North vs. South (Broad Patterns):**

**North India:**
- Patrilineal (generally)
- Exogamous (village, clan)
- Marriage: Far away (no close kin)
- Dowry (common)
- Hypergamy (marry up in status, ideally)

**South India:**
- Bilateral (some), Dravidian kinship
- **Cross-Cousin Marriage** (preferred)
  - Mother's brother's daughter (MBD)
  - Father's sister's daughter (FSD)
- Marriage: Close kin (relatives)
- Brideprice (some areas, or balanced exchange)

**Dravidian Kinship Terminology:**
- Crossness central (distinction)
- Parallel relatives (father's side, mother's side, same generation) = siblings (terminologically)
- Cross relatives (MB, FZ children) = potential spouses
- Alliance theory (LĂ©vi-Strauss interest)

**Louis Dumont & David Pocock:**
- Studied Dravidian kinship
- Terminological logic

---

## Religion: Hinduism

### Diversity

**Not Monolithic:**
- No single founder, text, authority
- Diverse practices, beliefs, deities

**Key Concepts:**

**Dharma:**
- Duty, righteousness (context-specific)
- Caste dharma (different for each)

**Karma:**
- Action, consequence (cause and effect)
- Shapes future births

**Samsara:**
- Cycle of rebirth (reincarnation)
- Goal: Liberation (*moksha*)

**Deities:**
- Polytheistic (many gods)
- Major: Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva (Trimurti)
- Goddesses: Durga, Kali, Lakshmi, Saraswati (powerful)
- Local deities (village gods, goddesses)

**Practices:**
- *Puja* (worship, offerings)
- Pilgrimage (sacred sites, rivers)
- Festivals (Diwali, Holi, Navaratri, many)

---

## Religion: Islam

### South Asian Context

**Arrival:**

- Bangladesh: ~90% Muslim
- India: ~15% Muslim (~200 million, large minority)

**Diversity:**
- Sunni (majority)
- Shia (minority)
- Sufi traditions (mystical, popular)

**Syncretism:**
- Hindu-Muslim interactions (shared practices, some contexts)
- Sufi shrines (*dargah*, pilgrimage by Hindus and Muslims)

---

## Religion: Buddhism

### Origins and Spread

**Birthplace:**
- South Asia (Nepal/India, 6th-5th C BCE)
- Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha)

**Decline in India:**
- Absorbed into Hinduism (Buddha as Vishnu avatar, some)
- Islamic conquest (destroyed monasteries)
- By 12th C: Nearly disappeared (India)

**Persistence:**
- Sri Lanka (Theravada Buddhism, majority)
- Bhutan (Vajrayana Buddhism, state religion)
- Ladakh (India, Tibetan Buddhism)
- Nepal (minority, but significant)

**Revival:**
- **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar** (1891-1956)
  - Dalit leader, scholar
  - Converted to Buddhism (1956, shortly before death)
  - Mass conversions (Dalits, escape caste)
  - Navayana Buddhism ("New Vehicle")
  - Millions of followers (Maharashtra especially)

---

## Pilgrimage

### Sacred Geography

**Importance:**
- Pilgrimage (*tirtha yatra*) = merit (Hindu)
- Sacred sites (rivers, mountains, temples)

**Victor Turner:**
- *"Pilgrimage and Communitas"* (1978, with Edith Turner)
- Studied Christian pilgrimage (but relevant)
- Liminality (see Phase 2, Turner's work)
- Communitas (equality, anti-structure during pilgrimage)

**South Asian Pilgrimage:**
- Ganges River (most sacred, Hindu)
- Varanasi (Benares, city on Ganges, cremation, liberation)
- Kumbh Mela (mass pilgrimage, every 12 years, largest gathering)
  - Millions (10-100+ million depending on year)
- Mount Kailash (Tibet, sacred Hindu/Buddhist/Jain/Bon)

---

## Gender

### Patriarchy and Resistance

**Challenges:**
- Patriarchal (generally)
- Son preference (strong)
- Female infanticide, sex-selective abortion (illegal but happens)

- Purdah (seclusion, some Muslim communities, some Hindu)
- Widow stigma (Hindu, historically severe, now better)

**Violence:**
- Domestic violence (common)
- Rape (underreported, stigma)
- Honor killings (some communities)

**Women's Movements:**
- Active (India especially)
- Legal reforms (some progress)
- **Nirbhaya case (2012):**
  - Gang rape, murder (Delhi)
  - Massive protests (nationwide)
  - Legal reforms (stricter laws)

**Resistance:**

## Development and Modernization

### Post-Independence

**Green Revolution (1960s-1970s):**
- Agricultural modernization (India)
- High-yield seeds, fertilizers, irrigation
- Increased production (food security)
- But: Benefits uneven (rich farmers profited more)
  - Landless poor (not much benefit)
  - Environmental costs (water depletion, chemical use)

**Industrialization:**
- Urban growth (rapid)
- Migration (rural to urban)
- Inequality (persists, increased)

**Neoliberalism (1990s+):**
- Economic liberalization (India)
- Growth (rapid, IT sector especially)

- Affirmative action (*reservations* for Scheduled Castes/Tribes)
  - Quotas (government jobs, education)
  - Controversial (debates about merit, who benefits)

**Reality:**
- Caste persists (socially)
- Marriage (still largely endogamous)
- Violence (Dalit atrocities, upper-caste violence)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is caste fundamentally religious (Dumont) or economic (Marxist)?

**Question 2:** Can affirmative action (reservations) eliminate caste inequality?

**Question 3:** How do we study hierarchy without reinforcing it?

**Question 4:** Is the "Indian village" a useful unit of analysis or colonial construct?

**Question 5:** What is the relationship between development and inequality in South Asia?
