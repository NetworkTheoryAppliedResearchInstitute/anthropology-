# Nationalism and Ethnicity: Imagined Communities and Political Identity

---

## Nations as Cultural Constructions

**Common assumptions:**
- Nations are natural, ancient
- Based on shared blood, language, culture
- Eternal entities

**Anthropological insight:** Nations are **modern, constructed, imagined**.

**Key Question:** How do nations and ethnic identities emerge, mobilize, and sometimes lead to violence?

## Benedict Anderson: "Imagined Communities" (1983)

### The Argument

**Nation = Imagined Community:**
- Members never meet most compatriots
- Yet feel deep horizontal comradeship
- "Imagined" but powerfully real
- Limited (has boundaries), sovereign

**Why "Imagined"?**
- Not face-to-face
- Constructed through symbols, narratives
- Requires shared imagination
- Media creates sense of simultaneity

**Not "Fake":**
- All communities larger than villages are imagined
- Doesn't mean false
- Real effects, real solidarity

### Conditions for Nationalism

**Historical Emergence (18th-19th centuries):**

**1. Print Capitalism:**
- Newspapers, novels
- Vernacular languages standardized
- Create "print languages"
- People read same news simultaneously
- **"Imagined community"** of readers

**2. Decline of Sacred Languages:**
- Latin, Arabic, Chinese as universal
- Vernacular languages gain prestige
- Each language → potential nation

**3. Decline of Dynastic Legitimacy:**
- Kings ruled by divine right
- Nations rule by popular sovereignty
- "We the people"

**4. Territorial State System:**
- Fixed borders
- Sovereignty over territory
- One state = one nation (ideal)

### Cultural Roots

**Nation Modeled On:**
- Religious community (universal, sacred)
- Dynastic realm (hierarchical center)
- Temporal conception (simultaneity)

**Transforms:**
- From religious to secular community
- From subjects to citizens
- From divine king to popular sovereignty

### Examples

> **Indonesia**
>
> **Anderson's Case:**
> - Dutch colony, hundreds of ethnic groups
> - "Indonesia" created through nationalist movement
> - Bahasa Indonesia (lingua franca) becomes national language
> - Newspapers, education create Indonesian identity
> - Not ancient—20th century construction

> **Philippines**
>
> **Spanish colony → US colony:**
> - José Rizal's novels
> - Create Filipino identity
> - Print capitalism
> - Anti-colonial nationalism

### Critique

**Partha Chatterjee:**
- Anderson too Western-centric
- Postcolonial nationalisms different
- "Whose imagined community?"
- Women, minorities excluded

**But Influential:**
- Shows nations as constructed
- Role of media, language
- Modern phenomenon

## Ethnicity: Constructed but Powerful

### Primordialism vs. Instrumentalism

**Primordialist View:**
- Ethnicity is ancient, deep, given
- Based on blood, kinship, culture
- Primordial attachments
- Natural, unchanging

**Instrumentalist View:**
- Ethnicity is constructed, situational
- Used strategically for power, resources
- Elites manipulate ethnic identity
- Changes over time

**Constructivist Synthesis:**
- Ethnicity is constructed BUT feels primordial
- Socially created but psychologically real
- Can be mobilized
- Context-dependent

### Frederik Barth: "Ethnic Groups and Boundaries" (1969)

**Key Insight:** Focus on **boundaries**, not cultural content.

**Argument:**

**Ethnic Groups:**
- Defined by boundaries they maintain
- Not by cultural "stuff" inside
- Boundaries persist even as culture changes
- **Self-ascription and ascription by others**

**Cultural Content:**
- Can change dramatically
- People still remain ethnically distinct
- Boundaries maintained through selective markers

**Example:**
- Pathans (Pakistan/Afghanistan)
- Share culture with neighbors
- But maintain ethnic boundary
- Certain markers emphasized (language, dress)

**Implications:**
- Ethnicity is relational (defined against others)
- Flexible, negotiable
- Contextual

### Situational Ethnicity

**People Have Multiple Identities:**
- Can emphasize different aspects situationally
- Ethnic identity in one context, class in another

> **Example: Arusha and Masai (Kenya/Tanzania)**
>
> **P.H. Gulliver:**
> - Arusha farmers
- Masai pastoralists
> - But intermarry, speak same language
> - Boundaries maintained through subsistence differences
> - Some individuals shift between groups

> **Example: African Americans**
>
> **John L. Jackson:**
> - "Racial paranoia"
> - Blackness as identity
> - But multiple ways to perform
> - Class, region, generation differences
> - Strategic essentialization

## Nationalism and Violence

### Ethnic Conflict

**Often Framed As:**
- "Ancient hatreds"
- Tribalism
- Inevitable clash

**Anthropological Analysis:**
- Usually modern, recent
- Often result of colonialism, state policies
- Instrumentalized by elites
- Economic competition

### Rwanda Genocide (1994)

**Background:**

**Hutu and Tutsi:**
- Not ancient tribal enemies
- Same language (Kinyarwanda)
- Intermarried
- Fluid categories (could change)

**Colonial Impact (Belgian):**
- Imposed ethnic IDs (identity cards)
- Favored Tutsi (chiefs, education)
- Created rigid categories
- Fueled resentment

**Post-Independence:**
- Hutu majority rule
- Tutsi minority oppressed
- Ethnic mobilization

**1994 Genocide:**
- Hutu extremists kill ~800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu
- Radio propaganda ("cockroaches")
- Neighbors kill neighbors
- Ethnicity mobilized for mass violence

**Anthropological Studies:**

**Mahmood Mamdani, "When Victims Become Killers":**
- Colonial creation of ethnic categories
- Political economy of violence
- Not primordial hatred

**Christopher Taylor:**
- Symbolic violence
- Body metaphors
- Cultural meanings

**Lessons:**
- Ethnicity can be weaponized
- Modern construction, not ancient
- Political mobilization crucial

### Former Yugoslavia

**Background:**

**"Balkanization":**
- Multi-ethnic state (Yugoslavia)
- Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, Albanians, etc.
- Coexisted for decades

**Collapse (1990s):**
- Ethnic nationalism
- Ethnic cleansing
- War crimes

**Anthropological Analysis:**

**Not Ancient Hatred:**
- Intermarriage common
- Shared neighborhoods
- Recent mobilization

**Robert Hayden:**
- Ethnic entrepreneurs
- Media propaganda
- Economic crisis
- Political manipulation

**Michael Sells:**
- Religious nationalism
- Sacred symbols mobilized

**Tone Bringa (Bosnia):**
- Neighbors became enemies
- Forced ethnic segregation
- Trauma of violence

## Post-Colonial Nationalism

### Anti-Colonial Movements

**Nationalism as Liberation:**
- Resist colonial rule
- Unify diverse groups
- Create national identity

**Examples:**
- Indian independence (Gandhi, Nehru)
- African nationalism (Nkrumah, Nyerere)
- Latin American revolutions

**Challenges:**

**Colonial Borders:**
- Arbitrary (carved by Europeans)
- Multiple ethnic groups within
- Divided ethnic groups across borders
- "Nations" without shared culture

**Post-Colonial States:**
- How to create unity?
- Nation-building projects
- Sometimes oppressive

### Nation-Building

**Strategies:**

**1. Official Nationalism:**
- National language
- National symbols (flag, anthem)
- National holidays
- Curriculum (history)

**2. Invented Traditions (Hobsbawm & Ranger):**
- "Ancient" traditions recently created
- Kilts, tartans (Scotland)
- "Tribal" costumes (Africa)
- Legitimize nation through "tradition"

**3. Suppression of Difference:**
- Forced assimilation
- Minority languages banned
- Cultural uniformity
- Can be violent

> **Example: Tanzania**
>
> **Julius Nyerere's Ujamaa:**
> - "African socialism"
> - Nation-building
> - Swahili as national language
> - Villagization (create Tanzanian identity)
> - Mostly successful, relatively peaceful

> **Example: Indonesia (Suharto Era)**
>
> **"Unity in Diversity":**
> - Motto: Bhinneka Tunggal Ika
> - But suppressed regional identities
> - Javanese dominance
> - East Timor violence

### Diasporic Nationalism

**Long-Distance Nationalism:**
- Migrants maintain homeland identity
- Send remittances
- Political influence
- "Imagined community" across borders

**Examples:**
- Irish diaspora (funding IRA)
- Tamil diaspora (Sri Lankan conflict)
- Palestinian diaspora
- Armenian diaspora

**Benedict Anderson:** "Long-distance nationalism" can be more extreme (no consequences for violence).

## Indigenous Nationalism

### Fourth World Nationalism

**Indigenous Peoples:**
- Within settler states
- Colonized but not eliminated
- Demand sovereignty, rights

**Movements:**
- Māori (New Zealand)
- First Nations (Canada)
- Native American (US)
- Aboriginal (Australia)
- Sami (Scandinavia)

**Claims:**
- Land rights
- Self-determination
- Cultural recognition
- Treaty rights

### Pan-Indigenous Movements

**Global Indigenous Movement:**
- UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007)
- International solidarity
- Shared colonization experience

**Anthropology's Role:**
- Document indigenous rights
- Support claims
- But also:
  - Define who counts as "indigenous"?
  - Essentialize cultures?
  - Power dynamics

---

## Multiculturalism vs. Assimilation

### Policy Approaches

**Assimilation:**
- Minorities adopt dominant culture
- "Melting pot" (US ideal)
- National unity through homogeneity
- Critiqued as erasure

**Multiculturalism:**
- Recognize, celebrate difference
- "Mosaic" (Canada)
- Plural society
- Critiqued as fragmenting

**Anthropological Studies:**

**Canada:**
- Official multiculturalism
- But Quebec nationalism
- Indigenous claims
- Complex

**Europe:**
- Immigration
- "Multiculturalism has failed" (Merkel, Cameron)
- Integration debates
- Rise of far-right

**US:**
- Shift from melting pot to multiculturalism
- Culture wars
- "Diversity"
- Ongoing tensions

## Nationalism and Globalization

### Tensions

**Globalization:**
- Transnational flows
- Weakens national borders
- Cosmopolitanism

**But Also:**
- Nationalist backlash
- "Protect our borders"
- Right-wing populism
- Brexit, Trump, etc.

**Arjun Appadurai, "Fear of Small Numbers" (2006):**

**Globalization Creates Anxiety:**
- Uncertainty about identity
- Fear of cultural loss
- Scapegoating minorities
- Ethnic violence

**"Incomplete" Majorities:**
- Nation-state ideal = ethnic purity
- Minorities prevent completion
- Violence to "complete" nation (ethnic cleansing)

---

## Race vs. Ethnicity

### Overlapping but Different

**Race:**
- Biological discourse (discredited scientifically)
- Phenotype (skin color, features)
- Imposed categories
- Hierarchical (white supremacy)
- Modern invention (colonial)

**Ethnicity:**
- Cultural discourse
- Language, religion, customs
- Self-identification (often)
- Not necessarily hierarchical
- Older concept

**In Practice:**
- Blurred
- "Racialized ethnicity"
- African American = race and ethnicity

**Michael Omi & Howard Winant, "Racial Formation":**
- Race as socially constructed
- Historical process
- Political struggle
- US context

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are nations inevitable, or could alternative political identities replace them?

**Question 2:** Is ethnic violence ever truly "ancient hatred," or always modern mobilization?

**Question 3:** Can nationalism be progressive (anti-colonial) or is it always exclusionary?

**Question 4:** Does multiculturalism strengthen or weaken national unity?

**Question 5:** Will globalization erode nationalism or provoke nationalist backlash?

**Remember:** Nations and ethnic identities are constructed, not primordial—but feel deeply real. Print capitalism, vernacular languages, and modern states created nations in the 18th-19th centuries. Ethnicity is defined by boundaries maintained, not cultural content. Both can be mobilized for solidarity or violence. "Ancient hatreds" are usually recent, instrumentalized by elites, products of colonial policies or economic competition. Post-colonial nations face challenges of diverse populations within arbitrary borders. Indigenous peoples assert distinct nationalisms. Multiculturalism and assimilation represent different approaches to diversity. Globalization both erodes and provokes nationalism. Understanding nationalism and ethnicity reveals how political identities are culturally constructed, historically specific, and powerfully consequential.
