## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is syncretism resistance, or just adaptation? Both?

**Question 2:** Can religions that emerged from oppression be fully "decolonized"?

**Question 3:** Who has authority to practice—only descendants of enslaved Africans?

**Question 4:** Are these "religions" or "cultural practices"? Does distinction matter?

**Question 5:** What makes a religion "authentic"—purity or vitality?

**Remember:** Vodou, Candomblé, and Santería are syncretic Afro-Atlantic religions born from slavery, mixing African cosmologies with Catholicism. Not "degraded" African traditions but creative new forms—resistance and adaptation. Vodou (Haiti) features lwa possession, Haitian Revolution connections, ongoing stigma. Candomblé (Brazil) preserves Yoruba orixás, female leadership, elaborate initiations. Santería (Cuba) maintains Lucumí language, divination centrality, diaspora spread. All share African roots (possession, divination, community), Catholic syncretism (strategic concealment + genuine blending), and transformation under oppression. Understanding these reveals religious creativity, cultural survival, and ongoing vitality—not relics but living traditions adapting to changing worlds.
