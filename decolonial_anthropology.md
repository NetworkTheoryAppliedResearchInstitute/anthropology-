# Decolonizing Anthropology: Reckon, Transform, Reimagine (1960s-Present)

---

## "Anthropology Must Die So That People Can Live"

In 2014, activist and scholar **Dylan Rodríguez** declared: **"Anthropology must die."**

Not literally end the discipline—but transform so fundamentally that its colonial foundations are destroyed, not just reformed.

This reflects ongoing **decolonial movements** challenging anthropology to:
- Reckon honestly with colonial origins and continuing colonial practices
- Center indigenous and colonized peoples' perspectives
- Transfer control of knowledge production
- Question fundamental assumptions
- Reimagine anthropology from ground up

**This isn't just critique—it's transformation already underway.**

## The Indictment: Anthropology's Colonial Present

### Not Just Historical Problem

**Yes, anthropology emerged from colonialism (Sessions 3-4).**

**But colonial patterns persist:**

**1. Extraction:**
- Western anthropologists take knowledge from non-Western communities
- Build careers on others' knowledge
- Communities don't benefit
- "Helicopter research"—fly in, gather data, fly out

**2. Representation:**
- Anthropologists speak FOR communities, not WITH
- Control how communities are represented
- Indigenous peoples can't control their own narratives

**3. Institutional Power:**
- Academic jobs in Western universities
- Funding from Western institutions
- Publishing in Western journals
- English-language dominance
- Who gets PhDs determines who becomes anthropologist

**4. Epistemological Violence:**
- Western knowledge systems treated as universal
- Indigenous knowledges dismissed as "belief," "myth," "traditional"
- Science vs. indigenous knowledge hierarchy
- Western frameworks imposed on non-Western realities

**5. Gatekeeping:**
- Peer review by Western academics
- Methodological standards reflect Western assumptions
- "Rigorous" often means Western
- Indigenous scholars' work judged by colonial criteria

## Indigenous Critiques: From Outside and Within

### Vine Deloria Jr.: "Custer Died for Your Sins" (1969)

**Standing Rock Sioux scholar's devastating critique:**

**Chapter: "Anthropologists and Other Friends":**

> "Into each life, it is said, some rain must fall. Some people have bad horoscopes, others take tips on the stock market... But Indians have been cursed above all other people in history. Indians have anthropologists."

**The Charges:**

**1. Exploitation:**
- Take sacred knowledge
- Publish without permission
- Build careers on Indian suffering
- Give nothing back

**2. Arrogance:**
- Claim to know Indians better than Indians know themselves
- Interpret Indian culture for Indians
- "Expert" status despite brief visits

**3. Distortion:**
- Freeze Indians in past
- Ignore contemporary realities
- Romantic stereotypes
- Indians as museum pieces

**4. Harmful Impact:**
- Anthropological "evidence" used against land claims
- Courts trust anthropologists over Indian testimony
- Romantic portrayals undermine political struggles
- Bureau of Indian Affairs anthropologists serve government, not tribes

**The Demand:** Let Indians speak for themselves.

### Linda Tuhiwai Smith: "Decolonizing Methodologies" (1999)

**Māori scholar's foundational text:**

**"Research is probably one of the dirtiest words in the indigenous world's vocabulary."**

**Why?**
- Research = colonialism
- Western research extracted knowledge
- Served colonial control
- Defined indigenous peoples as problems
- Never asked what indigenous peoples wanted

**Western Research Methods:**
- Assume researcher objectivity
- Extract data from "subjects"
- Privilege written word
- Individual ownership of knowledge
- Publication in Western academy

**Indigenous Research Ethics:**
- Researcher accountable to community
- Community controls research
- Oral knowledge respected
- Collective ownership
- Research serves community needs

**25 Indigenous Projects:**

Smith outlined research projects indigenous communities actually want:
- Claiming
- Testimonies
- Story telling
- Remembering
- Indigenizing
- Revitalizing
- Connecting
- Protecting
- Creating
- Negotiating
- Discovering
- Sharing
- Returning
- Democratizing
- Networking
- Naming
- Reframing

**Notice:** Not "objective" research but politically engaged, community-serving.

### Faye V. Harrison: Decolonizing Anthropology, Decentering the West

**African American anthropologist:**

**Argued:**
- Anthropology must confront racism within discipline
- US anthropology has marginalized scholars of color
- "Race" categories in anthropology reproduce racism
- Need anti-racist, decolonial anthropology

**"Decolonizing Anthropology" (1991/1997):**

Collected essays showing:
- Colonial legacy in method, theory, practice
- Alternative anthropologies from Global South
- Feminist and anti-racist critiques
- Calls for transformation

### Zoe Todd: Indigenous Feminist Critique

**Métis scholar (Canada):**

**"An Indigenous Feminist's Take on the Ontological Turn" (2016):**

**Argued:**
- Ontological turn (Session 6) claims to be radical
- But indigenous peoples always had these ontologies
- Western academy only listens when white theorists say it
- Bruno Latour gets celebrated for "discovering" what indigenous peoples always knew
- Indigenous scholars should be centered, not cited as examples

**The Pattern:**
- Indigenous knowledge: dismissed as myth
- White theorist says same thing: celebrated as innovative

**Epistemic violence:** Western academy determines what counts as knowledge.

## Indigenous Anthropology: From Within

### Growing Movement

**Indigenous scholars becoming anthropologists:**
- Study own communities (not exotic others)
- Challenge anthropological assumptions
- Bring indigenous perspectives
- Transform methodology

### Key Figures

**Audra Simpson (Mohawk):**

> **"Mohawk Interruptus" (2014):**
>
> Studied Mohawk refusal:
> - Refusing US/Canadian citizenship
> - Asserting sovereignty
> - "Ethnographic refusal"—refusing to explain everything to settler audience
> - Not making Mohawk legible to colonizers
> - Withholding as method

**Decolonial method:** Don't make indigenous peoples transparent to anthropological gaze.

**Kim TallBear (Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate):**

**"Native American DNA" (2013):**

Critiqued genetic ancestry testing:
- Treats indigenous identity as biological
- Ignores kinship, belonging, sovereignty
- Tribes determine citizenship, not DNA
- Science used to undermine indigenous claims

**Also:** Promotes indigenous science studies, indigenous feminist theory.

**Jessica Hernandez (Maya Ch'orti' and Binnizá):**

**Environmental scientist and anthropologist:**
- Traditional ecological knowledge
- Climate change from indigenous perspectives
- Decolonial science

### Characteristics of Indigenous Anthropology

**1. Community Accountability:**
Research serves community, not just career.

**2. Relationality:**
Knowledge is relational, not extractive.

**3. Reciprocity:**
Give back to community.

**4. Respect for Protocols:**
Follow indigenous protocols for knowledge sharing.

**5. Centering Indigenous Epistemologies:**
Indigenous ways of knowing as valid as Western science.

## Institutional Transformations

### NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 1990)

**US law requiring:**
- Museums return indigenous human remains
- Return sacred objects and cultural patrimony
- Tribes control disposition

**Transformed museum anthropology:**
- Can't just collect and keep
- Consultation required
- Indigenous control over sacred items

**Thousands of remains and objects returned.**

### Decolonizing the Curriculum

**Universities worldwide adding:**
- Indigenous perspectives
- Decolonial theory
- Courses on colonialism
- Hiring indigenous scholars

**American Anthropological Association (AAA):**
- Statements on race (rejecting scientific racism)
- Ethics codes emphasizing community consent
- Increasing diversity efforts
- Decolonization conversations

### Collaborative and Community-Based Research

**New Models:**
- Participatory action research
- Community-based participatory research
- Co-creation of knowledge
- Community ownership of data
- Publication with communities
- Plain language outputs for communities

> **Example: Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami Research Ethics Principles (2018):**
>
> - Inuit self-determination in research
> - Respect for Inuit culture and knowledge
> - Inclusion of Inuit in design and conduct
> - Free, prior, and informed consent
> - Inuit control over data and publication

## Epistemological Challenges

### What Is Knowledge?

**Western Epistemology:**
- Objective, universal
- Individual discovery
- Written, documented
- Replicable
- Peer reviewed (by Western academy)

**Indigenous Epistemologies (vary but often include):**
- Relational, situated
- Collective, transmitted
- Oral, embodied, experiential
- Land-based
- Validated by community, elders

**Decolonial Challenge:** Accept multiple epistemologies as equally valid.

### Whose Data? Whose Interpretation?

**Traditional:** Anthropologist owns data, has interpretive authority.

**Decolonial:** Community owns data, has interpretive authority—or at least shared ownership.

**Data Sovereignty:**
- Indigenous peoples control data about themselves
- No research without consent
- No publication without community approval
- Data stored/managed by community

**Example: First Nations Information Governance Centre (Canada):**
**OCAP® Principles:**
- **Ownership:** Community owns data
- **Control:** Community controls collection and use
- **Access:** Community decides access
- **Possession:** Community physically possesses data

## What Would Decolonized Anthropology Look Like?

### Different Visions

**1. Abolition:**
"Anthropology must die"—can't be reformed, must end.

**Why:** Too tied to colonialism, exploitation, Western supremacy.

**2. Transformation:**
Fundamentally restructure but keep anthropological inquiry.

**How:**
- Indigenous control
- Decolonial methods
- Anti-racist restructuring
- Epistemological pluralism

**3. Multiplication:**
Multiple anthropologies—Western, indigenous, Southern, African, etc.—in conversation as equals.

### Principles for Decolonial Practice

**1. Accountability to Communities:**
Research serves community needs and interests.

**2. Indigenous Leadership:**
Indigenous scholars lead research on indigenous communities.

**3. Reciprocity:**
Researchers give back—through collaboration, advocacy, resources.

**4. Respect for Protocols:**
Follow community protocols for knowledge sharing.

**5. Epistemological Humility:**
Western knowledge isn't superior—it's one way among many.

**6. Historical Reckoning:**
Acknowledge and address anthropology's colonial violence.

**7. Redistributing Resources:**
Fund indigenous scholars, communities, institutions.

**8. Political Engagement:**
Support indigenous sovereignty, land rights, justice.

## Ongoing Debates

### 1. Can Anthropology Be Decolonized?

**Skeptics:** Anthropology is inherently colonial—studying "others" reproduces colonial gaze.

**Reformers:** Anthropology can be transformed through indigenous leadership, decolonial methods.

### 2. Who Can Study Whom?

**Question:** Can non-indigenous anthropologists study indigenous communities?

**Positions:**
- **Yes, if:** Accountable, collaborative, respectful, community-approved
- **No:** Only indigenous peoples should represent themselves
- **Depends:** Context, relationship, power dynamics

### 3. Universalism vs. Pluralism

**Tension:**
- Anthropology seeks cross-cultural understanding (universalist impulse)
- Decolonial critique says Western universals are particular (pluralist critique)

**How balance:**
- Conversation across difference
- Without claiming universal truth?

### 4. Academic vs. Activist

**Can anthropology be:**
- Academically rigorous AND politically engaged?
- Objective AND advocacy-oriented?
- Scholarly AND serving communities?

**Decolonial answer:** False dichotomies. Engaged scholarship is rigorous.

## Contemporary Movements

### Black Studies and Decolonial Anthropology

**Katherine McKittrick, Sylvia Wynter, Christina Sharpe:**

**Argued:**
- Anthropology's "Man" is always European man
- Black peoples excluded from "human"
- Need Black studies to challenge this
- Decolonial anthropology must be anti-racist

### Feminist Decolonial Anthropology

**Intersectional approach:**
- Gender AND colonialism
- Decolonizing can't ignore patriarchy
- Indigenous feminisms
- Transnational feminisms

**María Lugones, Oyèrónkẹ́ Oyěwùmí, Chandra Talpade Mohanty**

### Global South Anthropologies

**Anthropologies in Africa, Latin America, Asia:**
- Not branches of Western anthropology
- Independent traditions
- Different questions and methods
- Conversation among equals

**Example: Brazilian anthropology** (distinct tradition, not derivative)

### Digital Decolonization

**Question:** Do digital tools decolonize or replicate colonial extraction?

**Possibilities:**
- Indigenous digital archives
- Community-controlled databases
- Online indigenous knowledge sharing

**Risks:**
- Extractive data mining
- Digital colonialism
- Surveillance

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can anthropology be decolonized, or must it be abolished and replaced?

**Question 2:** Should only indigenous people study indigenous communities, or can outsiders do so ethically?

**Question 3:** If Western epistemology isn't universal, how do anthropologists from different knowledge systems communicate?

**Question 4:** Is "giving back" to communities enough, or does decolonization require fundamental power transfer?

**Question 5:** What would you want if anthropologists studied your community? What accountability would you demand?

**Remember:** Decolonizing anthropology isn't a project to be completed—it's an ongoing struggle requiring constant vigilance, accountability, and transformation. It demands: centering indigenous voices and leadership, transferring control of knowledge production, recognizing multiple epistemologies, reckoning with colonial violence, redistributing resources and power. This is uncomfortable for anthropology—it challenges the discipline's foundations, authority, and practices. But discomfort is necessary. The question isn't whether anthropology should decolonize but how quickly and radically it will transform. Indigenous scholars and communities are leading the way—will anthropology follow?
