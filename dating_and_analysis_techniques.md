# Dating Techniques and Material Analysis: Building Chronologies

---

## Why Dating Matters

### Establishing When

**Fundamental:**
- Time is crucial
- When did X happen?
- Sequence of events
- Change over time

**Questions:**
- How old is this site?
- Which came first?
- How long did occupation last?
- Rate of change?

**Two Approaches:**
- Relative dating (earlier/later)
- Absolute dating (calendar years)

---

## Relative Dating

### Ordering Without Numbers

### Stratigraphy

**Superposition:**
- Deeper = older (unless disturbed)
- Relative sequence
- Foundation of archaeology

**Limitations:**
- Local (this site only)
- No absolute dates
- Disturbances (pits, burials)

### Seriation

**Method:**
- Order artifacts by style
- Assumption: styles change over time
- Peak popularity, then decline

**Frequency Seriation:**
- Plot frequencies (percentages)
- Battleship curves
- James Ford (pottery, southeastern US)

**Stylistic Seriation:**
- Evolution of forms
- Gravestones (New England, James Deetz)
- Death's heads → cherubs → willows

**Cross-Dating:**
- Link sites by shared types
- Build regional chronologies

**Example:**
- Southwestern US pottery
- Tree-ring dates calibrate
- Then extend to sites without tree-rings

### Fluorine Dating

**Method:**
- Bone absorbs fluorine from groundwater
- Over time, fluorine increases
- Compare bones from same deposit

**Piltdown Man (Fraud):**
- Kenneth Oakley (1950s)
- Fluorine test
- Skull modern, jawbone modern (ape)
- Different from ancient bones claimed
- Exposed hoax

**Limitations:**
- Relative only (same site)
- Groundwater varies

---

## Absolute Dating

### Calendar Years

**Goal:**
- Actual age (years ago)
- BP (Before Present, defined as 1950)
- BCE/CE (calendar years)

---

## Radiocarbon Dating

### Revolutionary Method

**Discovery:**
- Willard Libby (1940s-50s)
- Nobel Prize (1960)

**Principle:**
- Carbon-14 (radioactive isotope)
- Living things absorb C-14 (from atmosphere)
- Death: C-14 decays (no new intake)
- Half-life: 5,730 years
- Measure remaining C-14 → calculate age

**Materials:**
- Organic: charcoal, wood, bone, shell, seeds
- Not: stone, pottery (unless organic temper)

**Process:**
- Sample (grams of charcoal, etc.)
- Measure C-14/C-12 ratio
- Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS): tiny samples (milligrams)

**Range:**
- ~50,000 years (practical limit)
- Older: too little C-14 remains

**Calibration:**
- Atmospheric C-14 varies over time
- Tree rings calibrate (dendrochronology)
- Calibration curves (IntCal)
- Radiocarbon years ≠ calendar years
- Calibration essential

**Notation:**
- Uncalibrated: BP (radiocarbon years)
- Calibrated: cal BP or BCE/CE

**Example:**
- 3,000 BP radiocarbon
- Calibrated: ~3,200-3,400 cal BP (range)

**Revolutionized Archaeology:**
- Global chronologies
- Independent of historical records
- Resolved debates (Stonehenge, American archaeology)

**Limitations:**
- Organic materials only
- Contamination (modern carbon)
- Old wood problem (tree died long before use)
- Plateaus (calibration curve flat, wide ranges)

---

## Dendrochronology

### Tree-Ring Dating

**Method:**
- Count annual rings
- Each year = one ring
- Width varies (climate: wet years wide, dry years narrow)
- Match patterns (cross-dating)

**Andrew Ellicott Douglass (1920s):**
- Arizona, southwestern US
- Master chronology (thousands of years)

**How It Works:**
- Living trees → dead trees (overlap)
- Archaeological beams → extend back
- Bristlecone pine (California): 10,000+ years

**Precision:**
- Exact year (if bark present: "cutting date")
- Best absolute dating

**Calibration:**
- Radiocarbon calibrated by tree rings
- Independent check

**Limitations:**
- Specific regions (climate varies)
- Preserved wood needed
- Labor-intensive

**Where Used:**
- Southwestern US (Pueblo sites)
- Europe (oak)
- Some Asia

## Potassium-Argon (K-Ar) Dating

### For Deep Time

**Principle:**
- Potassium-40 decays to Argon-40
- Half-life: 1.3 billion years
- Volcanic rock

**Materials:**
- Volcanic ash, lava
- NOT organic

**Range:**
- >100,000 years (too slow for recent)
- Millions of years

**Applications:**
- Early hominins (Olduvai Gorge, East Africa)
- Lucy (Hadar, Ethiopia)
- Volcanic layers above/below fossils → bracket age

**Argon-Argon (40Ar/39Ar):**
- Refinement
- More precise
- Smaller samples

---

## Thermoluminescence (TL) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL)

### Trapped Electrons

**Principle:**
- Minerals (quartz, feldspar) accumulate electrons (radiation exposure)
- Heating or light exposure releases (resets clock)
- Burial: electrons accumulate again
- Lab: heat or light → measure luminescence → calculate time since last exposure

**TL (Thermoluminescence):**
- Heat releases
- Pottery (firing reset clock)

**OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence):**
- Light releases
- Sediments (burial)

**Range:**
- Few hundred to hundreds of thousands of years

**Applications:**
- Pottery (TL)
- Sediments, burnt flint (OSL)
- Early modern humans (Africa, Jebel Irhoud)

---

## Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)

### Tooth Enamel

**Principle:**
- Similar to TL/OSL

**Materials:**
- Tooth enamel
- Shell
- Coral

**Range:**

---

## Uranium Series Dating

### Radioactive Decay Chains

**Principle:**
- Uranium decays through series to lead
- Measure intermediate isotopes (thorium-230, protactinium-231)

**Materials:**
- Calcium carbonate (cave formations, coral, shell)

**Range:**
- ~500,000 years

**Applications:**

- Heated to high temperature

**Range:**
- Last ~10,000 years (where calibrated)

**Limitations:**

- Forms hydration rind (layer)
- Thickness increases over time

**Measurement:**
- Thin section under microscope
- Measure rind thickness

**Challenges:**
- Temperature-dependent (varies by location)
- Obsidian source variations
- Calibration difficult

**Used:**
- Western North America, Mesoamerica

---

## Amino Acid Racemization

### Protein Degradation

**Principle:**
- Living organisms: L-amino acids
- After death: convert to D-amino acids (racemization)
- Ratio D/L increases over time

**Materials:**
- Bone, shell, tooth enamel

**Challenges:**
- Temperature-dependent
- Contamination
- Calibration tricky

**Applications:**
- Pleistocene (Ice Age) sites

**Remember:** Dating establishes chronology—relative (stratigraphy superposition, seriation style changes, fluorine Piltdown fraud) vs. absolute (calendar years). **Radiocarbon dating** revolutionary (Libby 1940s Nobel 1960, C-14 decays half-life 5,730 years, organic materials, range ~50,000 years, calibration essential tree rings, uncalibrated BP vs. calibrated cal BP/BCE/CE, limitations contamination/old wood/plateaus). **Dendrochronology** tree rings annual (Douglass 1920s Arizona, exact year if bark present, bristlecone pine 10,000+ years, calibrates radiocarbon, southwestern US/Europe oak). **K-Ar/Ar-Ar** volcanic rock deep time (millions years, early hominins Olduvai/Lucy bracket age). **TL/OSL** trapped electrons (pottery firing/sediment burial, hundreds to hundreds of thousands years, Jebel Irhoud). ESR tooth enamel, uranium series cave formations. Material analysis: **lithics** (raw material/technology/typology/use-wear, obsidian sourcing XRF trace elements), **ceramics** (petrography/residue analysis lipids diet), **metallurgy** (composition/microstructure/lead isotopes provenance). **Isotope analysis**: stable carbon δ13C (C3 vs. C4 maize agriculture), nitrogen δ15N (trophic level marine vs. terrestrial), strontium 87Sr/86Sr (migration childhood tooth enamel vs. adult bone Amesbury Archer Alps), oxygen δ18O (climate/seasonality). **Ancient DNA** revolution (Pääbo/Willerslev, species ID/population genetics/migrations/admixture/kinship/sex, Ötzi/Kennewick Man/Cheddar Man). **Faunal analysis** zooarchaeology (species/NISP/MNI, diet/hunting/domestication, Binford Nunamiut). **Botanical analysis** paleoethnobotany (macrobotanical seeds flotation, microbotanical pollen/phytoliths/starch, diet/agriculture/environment). Understanding dating/analysis techniques reveals how archaeologists build chronologies and extract information from material remains—multiple methods triangulate, each has strengths/limitations, revolution ongoing with aDNA/isotopes.
