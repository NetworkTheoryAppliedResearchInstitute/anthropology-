# Human Adaptability: Epigenetics, Plasticity, and Environmental Extremes

---

## Human Adaptability

### Flexible Species

**Multiple Levels:**
1. Genetic adaptation (evolutionary, slow)
2. Developmental plasticity (ontogeny)
3. Acclimatization (physiological, reversible)
4. Cultural/behavioral (fastest, most flexible)

**Why Study?**
- Humans live everywhere (Arctic to equator, sea level to 5,000m)
- How do we adapt?
- Biology + culture
- Inform health, conservation, climate change

## Epigenetics

### Beyond DNA Sequence

**Definition:**
- Heritable changes in gene expression
- NOT changes in DNA sequence
- "Epi" = above/beyond

**Mechanisms:**

**DNA Methylation:**
- Methyl groups attach to DNA
- Silence genes (typically)
- Stable

**Histone Modification:**
- DNA wraps around histone proteins
- Modifications affect accessibility
- Acetylation, methylation

**Non-Coding RNA:**
- Regulate gene expression
- MicroRNA, long non-coding RNA

**Function:**
- Cell differentiation (liver vs. brain, same DNA)
- Response to environment
- Regulate development

---

## Environmental Epigenetics

### Experience Shapes Genes

**Fetal Environment:**
- In utero conditions
- Maternal nutrition
- Stress
- Toxins

**Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-45):**
- WWII famine
- Pregnant women starved
- Offspring: epigenetic changes
- Transmitted to grandchildren!
- Higher obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease

**Mechanism:**
- Genes methylated differently
- IGF2 gene (growth)
- Leptin (appetite)
- Lifespan effects

**Implications:**
- Environment affects inheritance
- Not fully genetic determinism
- Not fully environmental
- Interaction

---

## Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance

### Lamarck Partially Vindicated?

**Lamarck:**
- Acquired characteristics inherited
- Rejected (Darwin, Weismann)

**But:**
- Epigenetic changes CAN be inherited
- Not DNA sequence changes
- "Soft" inheritance

**Evidence:**

**C. elegans (Worms):**
- Starvation affects 3+ generations
- RNA-mediated

**Mice:**
- Odor fear conditioning
- Offspring fear same odor
- Epigenetic (sperm)

**Humans:**
- Debated
- Dutch Hunger Winter (2-3 generations)
- Överkalix study (Sweden)
  - Grandparental nutrition affects grandchildren
  - Paternal grandfather's food supply → grandson mortality

**Controversies:**
- How many generations?
- How robust?
- Mechanisms unclear (humans)

**Not Lamarckian Fully:**
- Not directed
- Random epigenetic variation + environment
- Selection still operates

---

## Developmental Plasticity

### Critical Periods

**Windows of Sensitivity:**
- Early development
- Environment shapes phenotype
- Permanent (often)

**Examples:**

**Height:**
- Nutrition (childhood)
- Critical periods (infancy, puberty)
- Adult height reflects childhood nutrition

**Brain Development:**
- Massive growth (prenatal, early childhood)
- Experience-dependent
- Synaptic pruning
- "Use it or lose it"

**Language:**
- Critical period (early childhood)
- Native fluency difficult (adults)
- Brain plasticity declines

**Immune System:**
- Early microbe exposure
- "Trained immunity"
- Hygiene hypothesis

---

## Phenotypic Plasticity

### Same Genes, Different Outcomes

**Definition:**
- Single genotype → multiple phenotypes
- Environment determines

**Examples:**

**Temperature (Reptiles):**
- Sex determination
- Turtles, crocodiles

**Water Fleas (Daphnia):**
- Predators present → grow helmet (defense)

**Humans:**
- Muscle mass (exercise)
- Skin tanning (UV exposure)
- Lung capacity (altitude, training)
- Calluses (friction)

**Adaptive:**
- Responds to environment
- Beneficial
- Flexible

**Limits:**
- Genetic constraints
- Critical periods
- Trade-offs

- Different evolutionary solution
- Andean approach has costs (chronic mountain sickness)
- Tibetan more "elegant"

**Cynthia Beall:**
- Leading researcher
- Discovered Tibetan adaptations
- Decades of fieldwork

**Denisovan Contribution:**
- EPAS1 variant from archaic hominins
- Interbreeding beneficial
- Adaptive introgression

### East African Highlands (Ethiopia)

**Altitude:** 2,000-3,000 meters (lower)

**Adaptations:**
- Intermediate
- High oxygen saturation
- Not extreme hemoglobin changes

**Settlement:**
- Recent (few thousand years)
- Less time for adaptation

**Convergent Evolution:**
- Three populations
- Independent adaptations
- Different genetic pathways
- Same problem, different solutions

---

## Acclimatization vs. Adaptation

### Distinguishing

**Acclimatization:**
- Individual level
- Physiological response
- Within lifetime
- Reversible
- Phenotypic plasticity

**Examples:**
- Lowlander visits altitude
  - Increased breathing rate
  - Increased red blood cells (2-3 weeks)
  - Improved (not fully)
- Returns to sea level → reverses

**Genetic Adaptation:**
- Population level
- Evolutionary
- Heritable
- Permanent (population)

**Tibetans:**
- Genetic adaptations (EPAS1)
- Still acclimatize (e.g., breathing rate)

**Developmental Acclimatization:**
- Growing up at altitude
- Larger chest cavity
- More permanent
- Phenotypic plasticity (developmental)

## Heat Adaptation

### Staying Cool

**Thermoregulation:**
- Maintain 37°C core temperature
- Too hot → heat stroke

**Physiological:**

**Sweating:**
- Humans = champion sweaters
- Eccrine glands (whole body)
- Evaporative cooling
- Need water

**Acclimatization:**
- Heat exposure (weeks)
- More efficient sweating (earlier, more dilute)
- Plasma volume expansion
- Heart rate decreases

**Genetic:**
- Body shape (Allen's/Bergmann's rules)
- Tall, thin (Nilotic peoples)
- Maximize surface area
- Less documented genes (compared to altitude)

**Cultural:**

## Cold Adaptation

### Staying Warm

**Challenges:**

- Conserve core heat

**Shivering:**
- Muscle contraction
- Heat production
- Energy costly

**Non-Shivering Thermogenesis:**
- Brown fat (babies, some adults)
- Mitochondria produce heat
- Arctic populations (Inuit): possibly more

**Metabolic:**
- Basal metabolic rate higher?
- Debated
- High-fat diet (Inuit)

**Acclimatization:**
- Cold exposure (chronic)
- Improved tolerance
- Faster rewarm (hands/feet)
- Reduced shivering

**Genetic:**
- Body shape (compact, Bergmann's rule)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can epigenetics explain health disparities?

**Question 2:** Why did Tibetans and Andeans adapt differently to altitude?

**Question 3:** Is human cultural evolution making biological evolution obsolete?

**Question 4:** Can we adapt to climate change fast enough?

**Question 5:** Should we edit genes to enhance adaptation (e.g., altitude)?

**Remember:** Human adaptability operates at multiple levels: genetic adaptation (slow evolutionary), developmental plasticity (critical periods), acclimatization (reversible physiological), cultural/behavioral (fastest). Epigenetics changes gene expression not DNA sequence (methylation, histone modification). Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-45 famine)—offspring/grandchildren obesity/diabetes/heart disease, transgenerational inheritance. Developmental plasticity critical periods (height/nutrition, brain, language, immune). Phenotypic plasticity same genes different outcomes (muscle mass, tanning, lung capacity). High altitude three populations three solutions: Andeans high hemoglobin (larger chest, chronic mountain sickness cost), Tibetans LOW hemoglobin high oxygen saturation (EPAS1 from Denisovans, 30,000 years, Cynthia Beall), Ethiopians intermediate (recent settlement). Acclimatization vs. adaptation: individual reversible vs. population genetic. Heat adaptation sweating champion (Nilotic tall/thin), cold adaptation vasoconstriction/shivering (Inuit compact, technology most important). Bajau divers larger spleens genetic (PDE10A, Ilardo). Biocultural adaptation culture + biology (fire/cooking, clothing, shelter, agriculture lactose tolerance, gene-culture coevolution faster). Niche construction modify environment (agriculture→malaria→sickle cell). Stress allostatic load, structural violence weathering. Climate change rapid, cultural adaptation needed, biological too slow. Understanding human adaptability reveals extraordinary flexibility—biology, plasticity, epigenetics, culture interact—we adapt faster culturally than genetically but face unprecedented rapid environmental change.
