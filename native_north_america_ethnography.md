# Native North America: Ethnographic Traditions and Contemporary Realities

---

## Introduction: Beyond Stereotypes

When most people think of Native Americans, they imagine:
- Tipis and feathered headdresses
- "Noble savages" living in harmony with nature
- Tragic victims who vanished with colonization
- Frozen in the 19th century

**All of these are profoundly wrong.**

> **Reality:** There are 574 federally recognized tribes in the United States alone, plus hundreds more in Canada and Mexico. They speak over 300 languages, have vastly different social organizations, occupy every ecological zone from Arctic tundra to desert to rainforest, and are very much alive today with vibrant, adapting cultures.

**Native North America is not a single culture—it's hundreds of distinct societies with different languages, beliefs, economies, and histories.**

## Cultural Areas Framework

### What Are Cultural Areas?

**Definition:** Regions where Native groups share similar:
- Subsistence strategies (how they made a living)
- Material culture (tools, housing, clothing)
- Social organization
- Ceremonial practices

**Origin:** Alfred Kroeber and other early 20th-century anthropologists developed this framework.

**Critique:** Cultural areas can oversimplify diversity within regions and reify boundaries that were actually fluid. But they're useful for organizing basic knowledge.

**Major Cultural Areas:**

1. **Arctic** (Inuit, Aleut)
2. **Subarctic** (Athapaskan peoples, Cree)
3. **Northwest Coast** (Tlingit, Haida, Kwakwaka'wakw)
4. **Plateau** (Nez Perce, Salish)
5. **California** (Chumash, Pomo, Yurok)
6. **Great Basin** (Shoshone, Paiute)
7. **Southwest** (Pueblo peoples, Navajo, Apache)
8. **Great Plains** (Lakota, Cheyenne, Comanche)
9. **Eastern Woodlands** (Iroquois, Algonquian peoples)
10. **Southeast** (Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw)

## Arctic: Inuit Adaptations

### Environment and Subsistence

**Challenge:** One of Earth's harshest environments
- Long, dark winters
- Extreme cold
- Limited plant foods
- Marine and land mammals primary resources

**Innovations:**

**Technology:**
- Kayak (sealed skin boat for hunting)
- Umiak (larger open skin boat)
- Dog sleds
- Snow houses (igloos) when traveling
- Warm clothing (caribou and seal skin)
- Harpoons, fish weirs, specialized hunting tools

**Knowledge:**
- Ice conditions (types of ice, safe/dangerous areas)
- Animal behavior (seal breathing holes, caribou migrations)
- Weather prediction
- Celestial navigation
- Snow conditions (Inuit have many words for snow types—though the "100 words for snow" is exaggerated)

**Sharing:**
- Generalized reciprocity (successful hunters share)
- Partnerships (trading partnerships across regions)
- Nobody could survive alone—cooperation essential

### Social Organization

**Bilateral kinship** (trace through both parents)

**Flexible bands:**
- Small groups (20-50 people typically)
- Composition changes seasonally
- Join/leave based on resources, conflicts, alliances

**Gender roles:**
- Men hunt large game (seals, walrus, whales, caribou)
- Women process hides, sew clothing, gather eggs, fish
- Clothing production critical (poor stitching = death from cold)

**Leadership:**
- No formal chiefs
- Influence based on skill, generosity, decision-making
- Consensus-based

### Beliefs and Practices

**Animism:**
- Animals have spirits/souls
- Must respect animal spirits to ensure future hunts
- Rituals to appease animal souls

**Shamans (angakkuit):**
- Mediate between human and spirit worlds
- Healing, divination, weather control
- Soul flights, spirit helpers

**Inua:**
- "Person" or spirit inside everything
- Must maintain proper relationships

**Sedna:**
- Sea goddess (Inuit mythology)
- Controls marine mammals
- Angered by human violations of taboos
- Shamans travel to comb her hair, appease her

**Taboos:**
- Sea and land animals kept separate
- Menstrual restrictions
- Proper disposal of bones
- Speech restrictions during hunts

### Contemporary Inuit

**Challenges:**
- Climate change (ice melting, hunting harder)
- Loss of language (residential schools, assimilation pressures)
- Substance abuse, suicide (legacy of colonialism)
- Food security (traditional foods harder to access, store-bought expensive)

**Resilience:**
- Land claims (Nunavut territory created 1999, Inuit self-government)
- Language revitalization efforts
- Cultural programs for youth
- Arctic sovereignty debates (Inuit voice increasingly important)
- Adaptation (snowmobiles, rifles, modern materials alongside traditional knowledge)

**Key Anthropologists:**
- Franz Boas (early Baffin Island work, 1880s)
- Knud Rasmussen (Greenlandic-Danish explorer-ethnographer)
- Jean Briggs (*Never in Anger*, 1970—emotional restraint among Utku)

## Northwest Coast: Wealth, Rank, and Potlatch

### Environment

**Resource-Rich:**
- Temperate rainforest
- Salmon runs (predictable, abundant)
- Sea mammals (seals, sea lions, whales)
- Shellfish
- Cedar trees (canoes, houses, totem poles, boxes)

**Result:** Sedentary villages, large populations, food surpluses, social hierarchy.

### Social Organization

**Ranked Society:**
- NOT egalitarian
- Chiefs, nobles, commoners, slaves
- Hereditary status (primogeniture—firstborn inherits)
- Wealth and prestige central

**Matrilineal descent** (many groups):
- Clan membership through mother
- Tlingit, Haida
- Moieties (dual divisions): Raven/Eagle, Killer Whale/Raven, etc.
- Exogamy (marry outside moiety)

**Houses:**
- Large plank houses
- Extended families
- House owned by chief
- Totem poles (crest poles, house posts—display lineage, stories, wealth)

### Potlatch: The Feast of Giving

**What Is Potlatch?**

A ceremonial feast where a host:
- Invites guests from other groups
- Distributes massive amounts of wealth (blankets, coppers, food, canoes)
- Validates status, claims, transitions (births, marriages, deaths, succession)
- Demonstrates wealth and generosity
- Guests witness and validate claims

**Purposes:**
- Establish/maintain rank
- Transfer rights (names, crests, territories)
- Settle disputes
- Redistribute wealth
- Political alliance

**Mechanism:**
- Host gives away or destroys property
- Guests receive according to rank
- Guests obligated to host bigger potlatch later (reciprocity)
- Failure to reciprocate = loss of status

**Example:** A chief might give away thousands of blankets, feast hundreds of guests for days, and even destroy valuable "coppers" (shield-shaped copper plaques worth immense wealth) to demonstrate he's so wealthy he can afford the loss.

**Colonial Suppression:**
- Canadian government banned potlatch (1885-1951)
- Seen as wasteful, impediment to assimilation
- Drove potlatch underground
- Masks, regalia confiscated

**Revival:**
- Post-1951, potlatch returns openly
- Cultural revitalization
- Museums return confiscated items
- Contemporary potlatches (blend tradition and modernity)

**Theoretical Importance:**
- Challenges Western economics (rational accumulation)
- Gift economy
- Prestige through giving, not hoarding
- Influenced Marcel Mauss (*The Gift*)

### Art and Material Culture

**Northwest Coast Art:**
- Formline design (distinctive ovoid, U-forms, split representation)
- Totem poles (narrative, genealogical, memorial)
- Masks (transformation masks with moving parts)
- Bentwood boxes (steamed cedar, intricate designs)
- Button blankets (trade wool blankets with mother-of-pearl buttons, crests)

**Carving tradition:**
- Master carvers (high status)
- Apprenticeship
- Rights to designs (owned by lineages)

**Contemporary:**
- Northwest Coast art globally recognized
- Artists (Bill Reid, Robert Davidson, others) renowned
- Museums, galleries
- Cultural reclamation

## Great Plains: Horses, Bison, and Warrior Societies

### The Plains Transformation

**Pre-Horse Era:**
- Some groups agricultural (Mandan, Hidatsa—villages, earth lodges)
- Some pedestrian bison hunters
- Limited mobility

**Horse Introduction (~1700):**
- Spanish horses spread from Southwest
- Revolutionary impact
- Hunting range expands
- Warfare intensifies
- Groups move onto Plains (Lakota from woodlands, Comanche from Great Basin)

**Classic Plains Culture (1700s-1880s):**
- Nomadic bison hunters
- Tipi dwellings (portable, conical skin tents)
- Highly mobile
- Warfare central to male prestige
- Horses = wealth

**This "classic" Plains culture lasted less than 200 years—a brief, dynamic period often mistaken for timeless tradition.**

### Social Organization

**Bands:**
- Autonomous groups
- 100-500 people typically
- Follow bison herds seasonally
- Come together for summer ceremonies (Sun Dance)

**Bilateral kinship:**
- Flexible affiliations
- Bands could split or merge

**Gender roles:**
- Men: Hunting, warfare, political decisions
- Women: Processing bison (hides, food), tipi maintenance, gathering
- Women's work essential but less prestigious

**Warrior Societies:**
- Age-graded associations (Kit Fox, Dog Soldiers, etc.)
- Military functions
- Police camps during communal hunts
- Prestige through war honors (counting coup)

**Counting Coup:**
- Touching enemy in battle (more prestigious than killing from distance)
- Stealing horses
- Elaborate ranking of war deeds
- Eagle feathers worn to display achievements

### Bison Hunting

**Communal Hunt:**
- Entire band cooperates
- Police societies enforce discipline (can't hunt early and scare herd)
- Buffalo jump (drive over cliff) or surround

**Importance:**
- Bison provided almost everything:
  - Meat (dried as pemmican)
  - Hides (tipis, clothing, robes)
  - Bones (tools, scrapers)
  - Sinew (thread, bowstrings)
  - Stomach (containers)
  - Dung (fuel)

**Near-Extinction:**
- Millions of bison in early 1800s
- By 1890s, fewer than 1,000
- US policy: Kill bison to starve Plains peoples, force reservation

### Sun Dance

**Major Ceremony:**
- Annual gathering (summer)
- Renewal, world regeneration
- Visions, supernatural power
- Self-sacrifice (piercing, fasting)

**Procedure:**
- Construct sacred lodge
- Dancing for days
- Some participants pierced (skewers through chest or back, attached to pole or bison skulls)
- Dance until skin tears free
- Visions, blessings

**Suppression:**
- US banned Sun Dance (1880s-1930s)
- Seen as savage, impediment to assimilation
- Practiced secretly
- Revived mid-20th century

**Contemporary:**
- Central to cultural identity
- Pan-Indian symbol
- Some non-Natives participate (controversy)

### Reservation Era and After

**Forced Sedentarization:**
- 1860s-1890s: Wars, treaties, reservations
- Bison gone, nomadism impossible
- Poverty, dependence on government rations
- Boarding schools (assimilation, language loss)

**Resilience:**
- Maintained languages, ceremonies (underground when necessary)
- Activism (American Indian Movement, 1960s-70s)
- Sovereignty struggles
- Cultural revitalization

**Contemporary Plains Peoples:**
- Lakota (Pine Ridge, other reservations)
- Poverty, health challenges
- But also: language programs, cultural centers, political activism
- Resistance at Standing Rock (Dakota Access Pipeline, 2016)

- Scattered camps (hogans—traditional octagonal log/earth homes)
- Flexible movements (follow sheep, resources)

**Religion:**
- Complex ceremonial system
- Healing ceremonies (Blessingway, Enemyway, etc.)
- Sandpaintings (ritually destroyed after ceremony)
- Holy People (supernatural beings)
- Harmony and balance central (hózhó)

**Long Walk (1864):**
- Kit Carson's campaign
- Scorched earth (destroy crops, orchards)
- 9,000 Navajos forced to walk 300 miles to Bosque Redondo (New Mexico)
- Internment, starvation, disease
- Released 1868, returned to homeland
- Treaty established Navajo Reservation

**Contemporary Navajo Nation:**
- Largest reservation in US (~27,000 sq mi, 3 states)
- Largest tribe by enrollment (~300,000)
- Navajo government (president, council)
- Language retention relatively strong
- Economic challenges (poverty, unemployment)

## Colonialism and Its Ongoing Impacts

### Demographic Catastrophe

**Pre-Contact Population:**
- Estimates vary: 5-15 million north of Mexico

**Disease:**
- Smallpox, measles, typhus, influenza
- No immunity
- 90%+ mortality in some areas
- Waves of epidemics (1500s-1800s)

## Contemporary Native America

### Demographics

- ~6.9 million American Indians/Alaska Natives (US Census 2020, alone or in combination)
- 574 federally recognized tribes (US)
- Urban majority (70%+ live in cities, not reservations)

### Revitalization

**Language:**
- Many languages critically endangered
- Immersion schools (Hawaiian, Navajo, others)
- Technology (apps, online courses)

**Cultural:**
- Powwows (pan-Indian gatherings, dance, music)
- Repatriation (NAGPRA—return of ancestral remains, sacred objects)
- Museums (National Museum of the American Indian)

**Political:**
- Tribal sovereignty strengthened (since 1970s)
- Gaming (casinos generate revenue for some tribes)

- MMIW movement (raising awareness)

### Diversity

**No single "Native American culture."**

Inuit in Alaska, Seminole in Florida, Navajo in Southwest, Ojibwe in Great Lakes—vastly different.

**Some are:**
- Wealthy (gaming revenue)
- Poor (isolated reservations, no resources)
- Urban professionals
- Traditional language speakers
- English-only
- Christian, traditional religion, both, neither

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** How does the "frozen in time" stereotype harm contemporary Native peoples?

**Question 2:** What does the diversity of Native North America reveal about human adaptability?

**Question 3:** How should the legacies of colonialism be addressed today (reparations, land return, apology)?

**Question 4:** Is cultural revitalization "authentic" if it uses modern technology and methods?

**Question 5:** What can the Iroquois Confederacy teach us about governance and democracy?

**Remember:** Native North America = hundreds of distinct cultures, languages, histories. Arctic hunters, salmon fishers, bison hunters, desert farmers, woodland agriculturalists—vastly different environments demanded different adaptations. Social organizations ranged from egalitarian bands to ranked chiefdoms to confederacies. Colonialism devastated populations, stole lands, suppressed cultures—but Native peoples persist, adapt, revitalize. Contemporary Native America is diverse: urban and rural, traditional and modern, sovereign nations navigating complex political landscapes. The "vanishing Indian" is a myth—Native peoples are here, alive, changing, continuingr.
