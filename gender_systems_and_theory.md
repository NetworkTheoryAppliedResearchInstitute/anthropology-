# Gender Systems and Feminist Anthropology

---

## Sex vs. Gender: The Foundational Distinction

**Classic Distinction:**
- **Sex** = biological (chromosomes, hormones, anatomy)
- **Gender** = cultural (roles, behaviors, identities)

**Why It Matters:**
- Challenges biological determinism
- "Biology is not destiny"
- Gender varies cross-culturally
- Therefore: learned, not innate

**Margaret Mead's Contribution:**

### "Sex and Temperament in Three Societies" (1935)

**Three New Guinea Groups:**

**Arapesh:**
- Both men and women gentle, nurturing
- "Feminine" by Western standards
- Cooperative, peaceful

**Mundugumor:**
- Both men and women aggressive, competitive
- "Masculine" by Western standards
- Violent, harsh

**Tchambuli:**
- REVERSED Western gender roles
- Women: practical, dominant, economic
- Men: artistic, emotional, decorative

**Mead's Argument:**
- Gender roles culturally constructed
- Not from biology
- Variable across societies

**Critique:**
- Oversimplified
- Fieldwork criticized
- But: influential, opened debate

## Feminist Anthropology Emerges

### Early Feminist Critiques

**Problem: Male Bias**
- Early anthropology male-dominated
- Studied men, ignored women
- "Man the Hunter" theories
- Women invisible

**1970s Feminist Intervention:**
- Demand women's perspectives
- Study women's lives
- Challenge androcentrism
- Theorize gender

### Michelle Rosaldo: "Woman, Culture, and Society" (1974)

**Public/Private Dichotomy:**

**Public:**
- Male domain
- Politics, economy, prestige
- Valued

**Private (Domestic):**
- Female domain
- Home, children, reproduction
- Devalued

**Universal?**
- Rosaldo initially argued yes
- Explains universal subordination

**Later Retracted:**
- Not universal
- Western bias
- Some societies don't separate
- Ideology, not fact

**But Influential:**
- Sparked debate
- Attention to domestic sphere
- Women's work visible

### Sherry Ortner: "Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?" (1974)

**Argument:**

**Universal Symbolism:**
- Women = Nature
- Men = Culture
- Culture transcends/controls nature
- Therefore: women subordinated

**Why This Association?**
- Women's bodies (reproduction, nursing)
- Closer to "natural" functions
- Men freer for "cultural" activities

**Universal Female Subordination?**
- Ortner argued yes (controversially)
- All societies value men higher

**Critique:**
- Universalizing
- Western categories (nature/culture)
- Ignores variation
- Essentialism

**Ortner Later Revised:**
- Not universal
- More complex
- But: provocative, influential

---

## Challenging Universals

### Eleanor Leacock: "Myths of Male Dominance" (1981)

**Argument:**
- Gender equality existed pre-colonialism
- Many indigenous societies egalitarian
- Colonialism imposed patriarchy

**Iroquois Example:**
- Women powerful (matrilineal, matrilocal)
- Controlled agriculture
- Selected chiefs
- Colonizers undermined

**Marxist-Feminist:**
- Mode of production shapes gender
- Foragers often egalitarian
- Agriculture → property → inequality
- Capitalism → patriarchy

**Critique:**
- Romanticizes pre-contact?
- But: anti-colonial analysis important

### Marilyn Strathern: "The Gender of the Gift" (1988)

**Melanesia Challenge:**

**Western Gender:**
- Individual persons
- Male/female opposition
- Fixed identities

**Melanesian Gender:**
- NOT individual
- Persons = composite, dividual
- Gender = relational, contextual
- Not opposition—flow, exchange

**"Androgyny":**
- Persons contain both male and female
- Context determines which activated

**Insight:**
- Can't impose Western categories
- Gender systems radically different
- Challenges sex/gender distinction itself

**Critique:**
- Difficult, dense
- But: important decentering

## Gender as Performance (Butler)

### Judith Butler: "Gender Trouble" (1990)

**Gender = Performative:**
- Not essence
- Repeated acts
- "Doing" gender
- Creates illusion of natural

**No Pre-Existing Identity:**
- Gender through performance
- Not expressing inner self
- Only doing, no being

**Drag:**
- Makes visible the construction
- Parody reveals gender as performance
- Subversive

**Sex/Gender Collapse:**
- "Sex" also culturally constructed
- Binary sex = ideology
- Intersex existence proves

**Influence:**
- Queer theory
- Transgender studies
- Anthropology: performance ethnography

---

## Masculinities

### Anthropology of Men

**Problem:**
- Men studied as "people"
- Women as "gendered"
- Men's gender invisible

**1980s-90s:**
- Study masculinity as cultural
- Multiple masculinities
- Not monolithic

### Matthew Gutmann: "The Meanings of Macho" (1996)

**Mexico City Ethnography:**

**Machismo:**
- Stereotype: aggressive, dominating, violent
- **Reality:** Complex, varied

**Men's Meanings:**
- Responsibility (provide for family)
- Respect
- Fidelity (some)
- Not violence

**Multiple Masculinities:**
- Working-class vs. middle-class
- Younger vs. older
- Context-dependent

**Insight:**
- Masculinity culturally specific
- Not universal "male nature"

### David Gilmore: "Manhood in the Making" (1990)

**Cross-Cultural Study:**

**"Real Man" Tests:**
- Impregnate (prove virility)
- Provide (economic)
- Protect (warrior)

**Rites of Passage:**
- Initiation often harsh
- "Make" men (not natural)
- Prove manhood

**Why Ubiquitous?**
- Gilmore: uncertain paternity?
- Social investment

**Critique:**
- Universalizing
- Functionalist
- But: comparative data useful

### R.W. Connell: "Masculinities" (1995)

**Hegemonic Masculinity:**
- Dominant form
- Idealised (rarely achieved)
- Other masculinities subordinated
- "Complicit" masculinities benefit

**Example:**
- Hegemonic: heterosexual, aggressive, successful
- Subordinated: gay, effeminate
- Complicit: most men (don't embody ideal but benefit)

**Multiple Masculinities:**
- Class, race, sexuality
- Hierarchies among men

**Patriarchal Dividend:**
- Men benefit from patriarchy
- Even if costs them too

## Gender and Work

### Sexual Division of Labor

**Universal?**
- All societies divide tasks by gender
- Content varies

**Judith Brown (1970):**

**Women's Work:**
- Compatible with childcare
- Near home
- Interruptible
- Not dangerous

**Men's Work:**
- Hunting, warfare
- Dangerous
- Distant
- Requires strength?

**Critique:**
- Assumes women's primary role = childcare
- Ignores variation
- Women warriors, hunters exist

### "Women's Work"

**Undervalued:**
- Domestic labor unpaid
- Invisible in GDP
- Essential but devalued

**Marilyn Waring, "If Women Counted":**
- Women's work uncounted
- Economics biased
- Reproduction = work

**Reproductive Labor:**
- Bearing, raising children
- Not just biology—work
- Social reproduction (next generation)

### Jane Collier: "Marriage and Inequality in Classless Societies" (1988)

**Bridewealth Societies:**
- Men need wealth for marriage
- Women = scarce resource
- Gender inequality in egalitarian societies
- Marriage politics

**Insight:**
- Gender inequality ≠ class inequality
- Can exist independently

---

## Colonialism and Gender

### Impact on Gender Systems

**Colonial Policies:**
- Imposed Victorian gender norms
- Undermined women's power
- Created/intensified patriarchy

**Examples:**

> **Iroquois (Leacock)**
>
> - Pre-contact: women powerful
> - Matrilineal, control agriculture
> - Select/depose chiefs
> - Colonizers dealt only with men
> - Women's power eroded

> **Africa (Various)**
>
> - Women farmers, traders
> - Colonial "development" targeted men
> - Cash crops (men), subsistence (women)
> - Women's economic power declined

> **India (Sati Debate)**
>
> - Widow immolation
> - British ban (1829)
> - "Civilizing mission"
> - But: Indigenous reform movements too
> - Gayatri Spivak: "white men saving brown women from brown men"

**Intersectionality:**
- Gender + race + class + colonialism
- Can't separate
- Crenshaw's concept

---

## Third Wave Feminism and Beyond

### Critiques of "Universal Woman"

**Problem:**
- First/second wave feminism
- Assumed universal women's experience
- Actually: white, middle-class, Western

**Women of Color Feminism:**
- bell hooks, Audre Lorde, Angela Davis
- Different experiences
- Race, class matter
- "Women" not monolithic

**Postcolonial Feminism:**
- Chandra Mohanty, Gayatri Spivak
- Critique Western feminism
- "Third World Woman" stereotype
- Imperialism in feminism

**Chandra Mohanty: "Under Western Eyes" (1984):**
- Western feminists construct "Third World Woman"
- Oppressed, passive, victim
- Ignores agency
- Reproduces colonialism

**Lila Abu-Lughod: "Do Muslim Women Need Saving?" (2002):**
- Critique "saving" rhetoric
- War on Terror justified as liberating women
- Orientalism
- Women's agency ignored

---

## Materialist Feminism

### Christine Delphy and Marxist Feminism

**Domestic Mode of Production:**
- Household = site of exploitation
- Women's unpaid labor
- Men benefit
- Patriarchy = material system

**Not Just Ideology:**
- Economic base
- Women's subordination material

### Gayle Rubin: "The Traffic in Women" (1975)

**Sex/Gender System:**
- Kinship systems traffic women
- Women = exchange objects
- Men = exchangers
- Marriage = women circulate

**Critique of Lévi-Strauss:**
- Alliance theory assumes male agency
- Women passive objects
- Foundational inequality

**Influence:**
- Feminist anthropology
- Showed gender in kinship
- Political economy approach

---

## Contemporary Feminist Anthropology

### Intersectionality

**Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989):**
- Gender + race + class intersect
- Not additive—multiplicative
- Different experiences

**Anthropology:**
- Ethnography shows intersections
- Context-specific
- Multiple axes of power

### Decolonial Feminism

**Linda Tuhiwai Smith:**
- Indigenous methodologies
- Decolonize research
- Indigenous women's knowledge

**Maria Lugones:**
- "Coloniality of gender"
- Gender imposed on colonized
- Pre-colonial gender systems erased

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is the sex/gender distinction still useful, or does it reinforce binaries?

**Question 2:** Can there be "universal" women's issues, or only context-specific ones?

**Question 3:** Do men lose from feminism, or gain (liberation from restrictive masculinity)?

**Question 4:** Is "women's work" inherently devalued, or can it be valued equally?

**Question 5:** How does gender intersect with other identities in your life?

**Remember:** Sex/gender distinction foundational—gender is culturally constructed, not biological destiny. Mead showed variation (Arapesh, Mundugumor, Tchambuli). Feminist anthropology challenged male bias, studied women's lives. Rosaldo's public/private and Ortner's nature/culture theories influential but critiqued as universalizing. Leacock showed colonialism imposed patriarchy. Strathern revealed Melanesian gender as radically different. Butler: gender is performative. Masculinities are multiple, culturally specific (Gutmann, Connell). Colonialism transformed gender systems globally. Intersectionality shows gender + race + class intersect. Understanding gender reveals how societies organize difference, labor, power—and how these arrangements are cultural, historical, changeable.
