# Climate Change, Environmental Justice, and the Anthropocene

---

## Climate Change Anthropology

### Anthropology's Contribution

**Why Anthropology Matters for Climate:**
- Local experiences (how people perceive, understand, respond)
- Cultural dimensions (beliefs, values, practices)
- Adaptation (indigenous knowledge, innovation)
- Vulnerability (who suffers most, why)
- Politics (climate justice, inequality)

**Methods:**
- Ethnography (long-term, local knowledge)
- Observation (actual practices, not just surveys)
- Contextual (political-economic, historical)

### Peruvian Andes

**"Glacier Retreat"** (with others, 2000s):
- Peruvian Andes (Quelccaya ice cap)
- Pastoralists (observe glaciers, interpret climate)

**Findings:**
- Local knowledge (glaciers shrinking, water patterns changing)
- Traditional indicators (plant phenology, animal behavior)
- Overlap with scientific data (but different frameworks)

**Integration:**
- Combining indigenous observations with science (better predictions)

---

## Susan Crate

### Siberia

**"Gone the Bull of Winter?"** (2008):
- Sakha (Yakut), northeastern Siberia
- Permafrost thawing (observable changes)

**Local Observations:**
- Winters warmer, shorter
- Ice roads (unreliable, dangerous)
- Buildings (foundations sinking, permafrost melts)
- Herding (disrupted, ice conditions)

**Cultural Meaning:**
- "Bull of winter" (cultural symbol, winter strength)
- Loss (environmental and cultural)

**Global-Local:**
- Siberia = early impacts (high latitude warming)
- Global emissions (local consequences)
- Injustice (Sakha contribute little, suffer greatly)

## Julie Cruikshank

### Yukon Glaciers

**Do Glaciers Listen?** (2005):
- Yukon, Canada (Tlingit, Tagish, Southern Tutchone)
- Glaciers (cultural significance, stories, relationships)

**Argument:**
- Western science: Glaciers = ice (physical, geological)
- Indigenous: Glaciers = sentient (responsive, relational)
  - Stories (glaciers punish disrespect, respond to behavior)
  - Ethics (how to behave around glaciers)
- **Not metaphor** (ontologically different, glaciers ARE responsive)

**Climate Change:**
- Glaciers retreating (observed, lamented)
- Explanation (Western science: CO2, greenhouse effect)
- Indigenous: Also disrespect, broken relationships

**Ontology:**
- Different ways of knowing (not reconcilable, but both valid in their contexts)

---

## Heather Lazrus

### Pacific Islands

**Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands:**
- Low-lying atolls (highest points ~5 meters)
- Sea level rise (existential threat)
- Predictions: Uninhabitable by 2100 (some estimates sooner)

**Migration:**
- "Climate refugees" (contentious term, no legal status)
- Where to go? (New Zealand, Australia, Fiji)
- Identity (tied to land, what happens when land disappears?)

**Lazrus:**
- Tuvalu ethnography (lived experiences, not just vulnerability)
- Agency (Tuvaluans not passive victims, activists, negotiators)
- Global climate justice (industrial nations caused, islands suffer)

---

## Elizabeth Marino

### Alaska

**Fierce Climate, Sacred Ground** (2015):
- Kivalina, Alaska (Iñupiat)
- Coastal erosion (permafrost thaw, sea ice loss, storms)
- Village (must relocate, estimated $400 million cost)

**Argument:**
- Climate change = immediate, not future
- Structural violence (U.S. government, oil companies, colonialism)
- Relocation (not just environmental, political-economic)
  - Who pays? (federal government reluctant)
  - Where? (loss of place, identity, subsistence)

**Lawsuit:**
- Kivalina sued oil companies (2008, climate change damages)
- Dismissed (2012, political question)

---

## Environmental Justice

### Definition

**Environmental Justice:**
- Fair distribution of environmental burdens and benefits
- Marginalized communities (disproportionate exposure to pollution, hazards)
- Participation (decision-making, who has voice)

**Origins:**
- U.S. civil rights movement (1980s)
- Warren County, North Carolina (1982, PCB landfill, Black community, protests)
- Studies: Toxic waste sites disproportionately in minority neighborhoods

**Principles:**
- Right to healthy environment
- Meaningful participation
- Fair treatment (no group bears disproportionate burden)

---

## Robert Bullard

### Environmental Racism

**Dumping in Dixie** (1990):
- Southern U.S. (toxic waste, pollution, Black communities)

**Argument:**
- Environmental racism (deliberate siting in minority communities)
- Institutional (zoning, permitting, enforcement)
- Least resistance (poor, minority communities, less political power)

**Examples:**
- "Cancer Alley" (Louisiana, petrochemical plants, Black communities, high cancer rates)
- Lead poisoning (Flint, Michigan, 2014-2016, Black majority, water crisis)

---

## Melissa Checker

### Polluted Promises

**Polluted Promises** (2005):
- Hyde Park, Augusta, Georgia (African American neighborhood)
- Pollution (industrial, Superfund site)
- Activism (residents organize, environmental justice)

**Findings:**
- Community knowledge (bodily experiences, illness patterns)
- Dismissed by authorities (not "scientific")
- Struggles (recognition, remediation, compensation)

---

## Climate Justice

### Global Inequality

**North-South Divide:**
- Emissions (historically: Global North, industrialization)
- Impacts (Global South suffers most, least responsible)
- Capacity (North has resources to adapt, South doesn't)

**Principles:**
- Common but differentiated responsibilities (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change)
- Historical responsibility (polluter pays)
- Equity (fair sharing of mitigation burdens, adaptation costs)

**Climate Debt:**
- North owes South (ecological debt, carbon debt)
- Reparations? (controversial, proposed by some Global South nations)

---

## Naomi Klein

### This Changes Everything

**This Changes Everything** (2014):
- Climate change and capitalism (incompatible)

**Argument:**
- Climate crisis = opportunity (transform economy, society)
- Neoliberal capitalism (growth, extraction) caused climate change
- Solution: System change (not just green technology)
- Blockadia (indigenous-led resistance to extraction, pipelines)

**Anthropology:**
- Not anthropologist, but influential
- Ethnographic examples (indigenous resistance, local struggles)

---

## The Anthropocene

### Defining the Epoch

**Anthropocene:**
- Proposed geological epoch
- Humans = geological force (transform planet)
- Start date (debated):
  - Agricultural revolution (~10,000 years ago)
  - Industrial revolution (~1800)
  - Great Acceleration (post-WWII, ~1950, preferred by many scientists)
  - Nuclear testing (1945, radioactive markers)

**Markers:**
- CO2 levels (atmosphere, ice cores)
- Plastics (global layer)
- Concrete
  - Nuclear isotopes
- Species extinctions (sixth mass extinction)

**Debates:**
- Geological (is it formally recognized? Working group says yes, awaiting ratification)
- Political (who is "anthropos"? All humans equally responsible?)

---

## Anthropology of the Anthropocene

### Critique and Engagement

**Critiques:**
- "Anthropos" (homogenizes, "humanity" implies all humans equal)
- **Actually:** Capitalism, colonialism, elites (not all humans equally)
- Alternative terms:
  - **Capitalocene** (Jason Moore, Andreas Malm): Capitalism, not humanity
  - **Plantationocene** (Donna Haraway, Anna Tsing): Plantation agriculture, monoculture
  - **Chthulucene** (Haraway): Multispecies entanglements, ongoing

**Engagement:**
- Anthropocene = useful (marks epoch, urgency)
- But: Must specify responsibilities (who caused, who suffers)

---

## Anna Tsing

### The Mushroom at the End of the World

**The Mushroom at the End of the World** (2015):
- Matsutake mushrooms (Oregon, Japan, commodity chain)
- Post-industrial landscapes (forests after logging, disturbance)

**Arguments:**
- **Precarity** (insecurity, life on damaged planet)
- **Assemblages** (humans, mushrooms, trees, multispecies)
- **Salvage capitalism** (value from ruins, post-industrial)
- **Indeterminacy** (future unknowable, not progress)

**Methodology:**
- Multi-sited (Oregon, Japan, China, Finland)
- Multispecies (fungi, trees, pickers, traders)

**Anthropocene:**
- Living in ruins (capitalism's damage)
- Collaboration (survival, not mastery)

---

## Donna Haraway

### Staying with the Trouble

**Staying with the Trouble** (2016):
- Multispecies, Anthropocene, response-ability

**Concepts:**
- **Kin-making** (expand kinship beyond human, beyond biological)
  - "Make kin, not babies" (population, reproduction)
- **Sympoiesis** (making-with, collaborative, not autopoiesis)
- **Response-ability** (ability to respond, responsibility, relational)
- **Tentacular thinking** (rhizomatic, interconnected)

**Chthulucene:**
- Alternative to Anthropocene (not human-centered)
- Ongoing, multispecies, earthly

**SF:**
- Science fiction, science fact, speculative fabulation, string figures
- Storytelling matters (how we narrate, shapes futures)

---

## Multispecies Ethnography

### Beyond Human

**Multispecies Ethnography:**
- Attends to nonhumans (animals, plants, fungi, microbes)
- Relationships (not humans separate from nature)
- Agency (nonhumans act, shape worlds)

**Origins:**
- Environmental anthropology, animal studies, STS (science and technology studies)
- 2000s-2010s (explicit articulation)

**Key Figures:**
- Anna Tsing (matsutake, forests)
- Donna Haraway (companion species, dogs, cyborgs)
- Thom van Dooren (extinction, flight ways)
- Eduardo Kohn (forests think, semiosis)
- Deborah Bird Rose (dingoes, ethics)

---

## Eduardo Kohn

### How Forests Think

**How Forests Think** (2013):
- Runa people (Ecuadorian Amazon)
- Forests (semiotic, representational)

**Argument:**
- NOT just humans think/represent
- All life (engages in semiosis, signs, interpretation)
- Dogs, jaguars, plants (interpret signs, respond)
- Runa (attune to forest semiosis, multispecies communication)

**Anthropology beyond human:**
- Expand anthropology (not just human meanings, but life's meanings)

---

## Thom van Dooren

### Flight Ways

**Flight Ways** (2014):
- Extinction (not abstract, specific species, stories)

**Cases:**
- Albatrosses (Pacific, ingesting plastic, fishing bycatch)
- Penguins (climate change, prey shifting)
- Vultures (India, diclofenac poisoning, collapse)
- Crows (Guam, Hawaiian, habitat loss)
- Condors (California, lead poisoning, captive breeding)

**Argument:**
- Extinction = not just species loss (relationships lost)
- Mourning (ethical response, care)
- **Dull edge of extinction** (slow, banal, ongoing, not catastrophic event)

**Method:**
- Ethnography (bird lives, human-bird relations)
- Multispecies (birds as subjects, not objects)

---

## Deborah Bird Rose

### Wild Dog Dreaming

**Dingo Makes Us Human** (1992), **Wild Dog Dreaming** (2011):
- Australian Aboriginal (Yarralin, Northern Territory)
- Dingoes (wild dogs, kin, companions, not pests)

**Argument:**
- Dingoes = persons (Aboriginal ontology)
- Kin relationships (obligations, reciprocity)
- European settlers (dingoes = vermin, kill)
- **Dialogue:** Aboriginal ethics (care for country, multispecies kinship)

**Ethics:**
- Responsibility (to multispecies kin)
- Country (land, animals, plants, all related)

---

## Eben Kirksey

### Emergent Ecologies

**Emergent Ecologies** (2015):
- Multispecies, global (Costa Rica, New Zealand, Australia, U.S.)
- Humans, frogs, microbes, stem cells, biotech

**Argument:**
- Emergence (unpredictable, new natures)
- Biotechnology (rewilding, de-extinction, gene editing)
- Hope and concern (playing god? Or creative responses?)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is climate change an environmental or political problem?

**Question 2:** Should we call it the Anthropocene or Capitalocene?

**Question 3:** What do we owe to nonhuman species?

**Question 4:** Can Western science and indigenous knowledge coexist?

**Question 5:** Is multispecies ethnography still anthropology?
