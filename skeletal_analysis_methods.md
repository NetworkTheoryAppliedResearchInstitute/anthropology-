# Skeletal Analysis: Reading the Bones

---

## Bioarchaeology vs. Forensic Anthropology

### Related but Distinct

**Bioarchaeology:**
- Study of human remains from archaeological contexts
- Past populations
- Health, disease, lifestyle
- Historical questions

**Forensic Anthropology:**
- Apply osteology to legal cases
- Recent remains (medico-legal)
- Identification
- Cause/manner of death
- Court testimony

**Overlap:**
- Same methods
- Skeletal analysis
- Both read bones

## The Human Skeleton

### 206 Bones (Adult)

**Composition:**
- Organic: collagen (flexibility)
- Inorganic: hydroxyapatite/calcium phosphate (hardness)
- Living tissue (in life)

**Bone Types:**
- Long bones (femur, humerus)
- Short bones (carpals, tarsals)
- Flat bones (skull, scapula, pelvis)
- Irregular bones (vertebrae)

**Preservation:**
- Bones survive burial (mineralized)
- Soft tissue decays
- Environment affects preservation

---

## Taphonomy

### What Happens After Death

**Definition:**
- Study of post-mortem processes
- What happens to body/bones

**Decomposition:**
1. Fresh (autolysis begins)
2. Bloat (bacteria, gases)
3. Active decay (loss of soft tissue)
4. Advanced decay
5. Skeletonization (bones remain)

**Time varies:**
- Environment (hot/humid faster)
- Burial vs. surface
- Scavengers
- Insect activity

**Bone Survival:**
- Soil pH (acidic dissolves bone)
- Water table
- Temperature
- Microbial activity

**Taphonomic Changes:**
- Weathering (sun, rain)
- Root etching (plant roots)
- Carnivore gnawing
- Trampling
- Burning
- Burial practices

**Distinguish:**
- Peri-mortem (at death)
- Post-mortem (after death)
- Ante-mortem (before death, healed)

## Biological Profile

### The "Big Four" (Plus One)

**Forensic anthropologists estimate:**
1. Sex
2. Age
3. Ancestry
4. Stature
5. (Individuating features)

**Goal:**
- Narrow identification
- Biological profile
- Compare to missing persons

---

## Sex Estimation

### Sexual Dimorphism in Skeleton

**Most Reliable: Pelvis**
- Adapted for childbirth (females)
- Differences clear

**Pelvic Features:**

**Subpubic Angle:**
- Female: >90° (wide, U-shaped)
- Male: <90° (narrow, V-shaped)

**Sciatic Notch:**
- Female: wide (>68°)
- Male: narrow

**Pubic Bone:**
- Female: longer, rectangular
- Male: shorter, triangular

**Pelvic Inlet:**
- Female: oval (wide)
- Male: heart-shaped

**Accuracy:** ~95% with pelvis

**Skull:**
- Less reliable (~80-85%)
- Males: more robust
  - Larger mastoid process
  - Larger supraorbital ridge (brow)
  - Squarer jaw
  - More sloping forehead
- Females: gracile
  - Smaller features
  - Rounder forehead

**Long Bones:**
- Males larger (on average)
- Metrics (measurements)
- Discriminant functions
- Population-specific

**Subadults:**
- Very difficult
- Pelvis not developed
- DNA testing better

---

## Age Estimation

### Changes Over Life

**Subadults (Birth-20):**
- Tooth eruption (most reliable)
- Epiphyseal fusion (growth plates)
- Long bone lengths

**Dental Eruption:**
- Predictable sequence
- Baby teeth, adult teeth
- Third molars (wisdom teeth) 18-25

**Epiphyseal Fusion:**
- Growth plates close (fuse)
- Sequence known
- Proximal humerus ~20
- Clavicle last (~25-30)

**Adults:**
- More difficult (no growth)
- Degenerative changes
- More variable

**Pubic Symphysis:**
- Face changes with age
- Rougher → smoother → degenerative
- Todd (1920s), Brooks & Suchey (1990)
- Phases (I-VI or I-VIII)
- Broad ranges (e.g., 25-45)

**Auricular Surface (Ilium):**
- Changes with age
- Lovejoy method

**Cranial Sutures:**
- Skull bones fuse
- Sagittal, coronal, lambdoidal
- Unreliable (high variation)

**Dental Wear:**
- Teeth wear with age
- Population-specific (diet)

**Rib Sternal Ends:**
- İşcan method
- Changes shape

**Accuracy:**
- Subadults: ±2-3 years
- Adults: ±10-15 years (increases with age)

## Ancestry Estimation

### Controversial

**Traditional Approach:**
- Estimate "race" from skull
- Three categories: African, Asian, European
- Measurements, morphology

**Problems:**
- Race not biological (see [[../variation/race_concept_critique.md]])
- Categories arbitrary
- Clinal variation
- Admixture common
- Reinforces race as biological

**Critique:**
- Forensic anthropology slow to change
- Still uses "race"
- Should use "ancestry" (geographic)

**Methods:**

**Cranial Morphology:**
- Nasal aperture shape
- Prognathism (jaw projection)
- Orbital shape
- Zygomatic bones

**"African Ancestry":**
- Wide nasal aperture
- Prognathism
- Rectangular orbits

**"European Ancestry":**
- Narrow nasal aperture
- Orthognathic (flat face)
- Square orbits

**"Asian Ancestry":**
- Shovel-shaped incisors
- Flat face
- Round orbits

**Metric Analysis:**
- FORDISC software
- Measurements
- Compare to reference populations
- Statistical classification

**Limitations:**
- Only works for "typical" individuals
- Mixed ancestry difficult
- Population variation
- Better than guessing, but imperfect

**DNA:**
- Can estimate ancestry
- Molecular anthropology
- More accurate
- But: expensive

**Moving Forward:**
- Use "ancestry" not "race"
- Acknowledge limitations
- Social categories don't map to biology
- Biogeographic ancestry better term

## Stature Estimation

### How Tall?

**Long Bones:**
- Femur most reliable
- Humerus, tibia, radius

**Regression Formulas:**
- Trotter & Gleser (1950s, updated)
- Population-specific
- Sex-specific
- Measure bone length → calculate stature

**Example:**
- Male white: Stature = 2.38(femur length) + 61.41 cm

**Accuracy:**
- ±4-5 cm

**Challenges:**
- Incomplete skeleton
- Pathology (e.g., arthritis affects joints)
- Fragmentary

---

## Individualizing Features

### Unique Characteristics

**Antemortem Injuries:**
- Healed fractures
- Surgical implants (pins, plates)
- Amputations
- Dental work

**Pathology:**
- Arthritis patterns
- Unusual conditions

**Anatomical Variants:**
- Extra bones
- Fused bones
- Asymmetries

**Radiographic Comparison:**
- Compare postmortem X-rays to antemortem
- Sinus patterns (frontal sinuses unique)
- Trabecular patterns

**Dental:**
- Fillings, crowns, root canals
- Missing teeth
- Unique restorations
- Dental records critical

---

## Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI)

### Commingled Remains

**Problem:**
- Multiple skeletons mixed
- How many people?

**Method:**
- Count most frequent bone (by side)
- Right femurs = 5 → MNI = 5
- Age, size differences

**Mass Graves:**
- MNI critical
- Genocide investigations
- Clyde Snow (forensic pioneer)

---

## Bone Trauma

### Reading Injuries

**Types:**

**Blunt Force:**
- Impact (fall, blow)
- Fracture patterns
- Depressed fractures (skull)
- Concentric/radiating fractures

**Sharp Force:**
- Cut marks (knife, sword)
- V-shaped kerf
- Chop marks (axe, machete)

**Projectile:**
- Gunshot
- Arrow
- Entry vs. exit wounds

**Timing:**

**Antemortem (Before Death):**
- Healed or healing
- Remodeling, callus formation
- Survived injury

**Perimortem (At/Near Death):**
- Fresh bone fracture pattern
- No healing
- "Green bone" response
- Smooth fracture edges

**Postmortem (After Death):**
- Dry bone fracture
- Jagged, different color
- No vital response

**Forensic Importance:**
- Manner of death
- Homicide vs. accident
- Weapon type

## Positive Identification

### Confirming Identity

**Methods:**

**1. Fingerprints:**
- Soft tissue (if present)
- Unique
- Database (AFIS)

**2. Dental Comparison:**
- Compare to dental records
- Highly reliable
- Unique restorations

**3. DNA:**
- Compare to relatives
- Or: antemortem sample (toothbrush)
- Gold standard
- Expensive, time-consuming

**4. Radiographic:**
- X-ray comparison
- Sinus patterns
- Old fractures

**5. Surgical Implants:**
- Serial numbers
- Manufacturer records

**Levels:**
- Presumptive (biological profile matches)
- Positive (definitive - DNA, dental, fingerprints)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Should forensic anthropology abandon "race" categories entirely?

**Question 2:** Is it ethical to use skeletons for teaching/research?

**Question 3:** How accurate must identification be for legal purposes?

**Question 4:** Should all unidentified remains be DNA tested (cost)?

**Question 5:** What if biological profile matches multiple missing persons?

**Remember:** Bioarchaeology studies past populations, forensic anthropology applies to legal cases—same skeletal analysis methods. Human skeleton 206 bones (adult), organic (collagen) + inorganic (hydroxyapatite). Taphonomy studies post-mortem processes (decomposition, skeletonization, preservation varies with environment). Biological profile estimates: (1) Sex (pelvis most reliable ~95%, subpubic angle/sciatic notch, skull ~80-85%), (2) Age (subadults dental eruption/epiphyseal fusion accurate ±2-3 years, adults pubic symphysis/auricular surface ±10-15 years), (3) Ancestry (controversial—should use ancestry not race, cranial morphology/FORDISC, reinforces race as biological, DNA better), (4) Stature (long bone regression formulas ±4-5 cm), (5) Individualizing features (healed fractures, dental work, implants). Trauma analysis: blunt/sharp/projectile force, timing antemortem (healed) vs. perimortem (at death fresh bone) vs. postmortem (dry bone). Positive ID: fingerprints, dental, DNA (gold standard), radiographic. MNI for commingled remains. Understanding skeletal analysis reveals how anthropologists read bones to reconstruct life, death, identity—powerful forensic tool but ancestry estimation problematic.
