# Cross-Cutting Theme: Globalization and Transnationalism

---

## Globalization and Transnationalism Across Anthropology

### Definitions

**Globalization:**
- Intensification of worldwide interconnections (economic, political, cultural)
- Compression of space and time (David Harvey)
- Flows across borders (capital, goods, people, ideas, images)
- Uneven (not all places, people equally integrated)

**Transnationalism:**
- Lives, practices spanning multiple nation-states
- Migrants maintain ties to home while in host country
- Social fields (extend across borders)
- Identity (not either/or, but both/and)

**Anthropology's Contribution:**
- Ethnography (how people experience, navigate globalization)
- Local appropriations (global NOT homogenizing, locally transformed)
- Inequality (winners and losers of globalization)
- Historical depth (globalization NOT new, long history)

---

## Historical Globalization

### World Systems Theory

**Immanuel Wallerstein:**
- Modern world-system (emerged 16th century, capitalist)
- Core (industrialized, wealthy, exploits)
- Periphery (raw materials, cheap labor, exploited)
- Semi-periphery (intermediate, e.g., Brazil, Turkey)

**Eric Wolf:**
- *Europe and the People Without History* (1982)
- No isolated societies (all connected through colonialism, trade)
- "Primitive" = produced by colonialism (not untouched by it)

**Anthropology:**
- Cannot study societies in isolation (always already global)

---

## Globalization in Kinship

### Transnational Families

**Migration:**
- Family members (scattered across countries)
- Remittances (economic ties, obligations)
- Communication (phone, video calls, maintain relationships)

**Examples:**
- Filipina domestic workers (Hong Kong, Middle East, send money home)
- Mexican migrants (U.S., maintain ties to villages)
- South Asian diaspora (maintain marriages, property in homeland)

**Challenges:**
- Separation (parents from children, "parachute kids")
- Care work (transnational mothering, Hondagneu-Sotelo)
- Citizenship (children born abroad, mixed status families)

### Reproductive Technologies

**Global:**
- IVF, surrogacy (transnational, Indian surrogates for Western couples)
- Egg/sperm donation (cross-border)
- Medical tourism (fertility treatment abroad)

**Inequality:**
- Wealthy (access to global markets, technologies)
- Poor (bodies commodified, surrogates, egg donors)

---

## Globalization in Economic Anthropology

### Global Capitalism

**Neoliberalism:**
- Free trade, privatization, deregulation

- Clothing (cotton India, sewing Bangladesh, sold U.S.)
- Extraction (Global South resources, Global North consumption)

**Labor Migration:**
- Workers (cross borders for jobs)
- Remittances (billions annually, crucial to many economies)
- Precarity (undocumented, exploited)

### Alternative Globalizations

**Fair Trade:**
- Direct trade (bypasses middlemen, better prices for producers)
- Certification (standards, monitoring)
- Debates (does it help? Or just niche market?)

**Social Movements:**
- Alter-globalization (World Social Forum, "Another world is possible")
- Occupy, anti-austerity, climate justice (transnational)

---

## Globalization in Political Anthropology

### Religious Conflict

**Sectarianism:**

## Globalization in Medical Anthropology

### Global Health

**Diseases:**
- Pandemic (COVID-19, 2020-2022, global, unequal impacts)

**Surgery:**
- Cosmetic, cardiac, orthopedic (medical travel)
- Lower costs (but variable quality, risks)

**Organs:**
- Transplant tourism (illegal, exploitative)

---

## Globalization and Language

### Linguistic Imperialism

**English:**
- Global lingua franca (business, science, education)
- Spreads (often at expense of local languages)
- Inequality (native speakers, advantage)

**Language Death:**
- Globalization accelerates (thousands of languages endangered)
- Youth (shift to dominant languages, economic opportunity)

**Resistance:**
- Language revitalization (Welsh, Hawaiian, Maori, others)
- Technology (apps, online resources)

### Code-Switching

**Multilingualism:**
- Migrants, cosmopolitans (switch languages strategically)
- Hybridity (Spanglish, Hinglish, linguistic creativity)

---

## Globalization in Archaeology

### Ancient Globalization

**Silk Road:**
- Han China to Roman Empire (trade, ideas, religions spread)
- Long-distance trade (NOT isolated civilizations)

**Indian Ocean:**
- Maritime trade (Africa, Arabia, India, Southeast Asia)

- Pull (city jobs, services, imagined better life)

**Transnational Urbanism:**
- Diaspora communities (ethnic neighborhoods, maintain ties)
- Little Indias, Chinatowns, Little Havanas

---

## Globalization and Environment

### Climate Change

**Global:**
- Greenhouse gases (accumulate globally, not locally)
- Impacts (worldwide, but uneven, Global South suffers most)

**Injustice:**
- Global North (industrialized, historical emissions)
- Global South (suffers impacts, contributes least)
- Climate debt (North owes South)

### Biodiversity

**Loss:**
- Globalization (habitat destruction, species invasions, extinctions)
- Sixth mass extinction (ongoing, human-caused)

**Conservation:**
- Transnational (global NGOs, funding, interventions)
- Fortress conservation (often displaces locals)

---

## Globalization and Digital Technologies

### Internet

**Global:**
- Billions online (but digital divide, uneven access)
- Information flows (instantaneous, worldwide)

**Cultural Flows:**
- Appadurai (ethnoscapes, mediascapes, technoscapes, financescapes, ideoscapes)
- Deterritorialization (culture NOT bounded by place)

### Social Media

**Transnational:**

- Daniel Miller (*Why We Post*): Social media = culturally variable

### Platform Capitalism

**Tech Giants:**
- Google, Facebook, Amazon (global monopolies)
- Data extraction (worldwide, surveillance capitalism)
- Labor (ghost work, global, precarious)

---

## Theoretical Perspectives

### Arjun Appadurai

**Modernity at Large** (1996):
- Five "scapes" (flows):
  1. **Ethnoscapes:** People (migrants, tourists, refugees, workers)
  2. **Mediascapes:** Images (media, films, news)
  3. **Technoscapes:** Technology (machines, software)
  4. **Financescapes:** Capital (money, investment, speculation)
  5. **Ideoscapes:** Ideas (democracy, human rights, ideologies)

**Disjuncture:**
- Flows NOT synchronized (money ≠ people ≠ images)
- Friction, unpredictability

**Imagination:**
- Central to modern subjectivity (people imagine lives elsewhere)
- Media (enables imagination beyond local)

### Anna Tsing

**Friction** (2005):
- Globalization NOT smooth (friction, awkward engagements)
- Universal projects (encounter particular contexts, transform)
- Example: Rainforest conservation (global environmentalists + Indonesian villagers + military, complex)

**The Mushroom at the End of the World** (2015):
- Matsutake mushrooms (global commodity chain, Oregon-Japan)
- Salvage capitalism (value from ruins, post-industrial)
- Precarity (global condition, insecurity)

### Aihwa Ong

**Flexible Citizenship** (1999):
- Chinese diaspora (strategic accumulation of passports, residences)
- Transnational capitalist class (mobile, multiple allegiances)
- Neoliberalism (encourages flexibility, mobility)

**Neoliberalism as Exception** (2006):
- Neoliberalism (variegated, exceptions, not uniform)
- Zones (special economic zones, different rules)

---

## Critiques of Globalization

### Cultural Imperialism

**Concern:**
- Western (especially American) culture dominates globally
- McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Hollywood (homogenization)

**Response:**
- Localization (McDonald's adapts menus, India vegetarian)
- Appropriation (hip-hop global, but transformed locally)
- Reverse flows (Bollywood, K-pop, Global South exports)

### Inequality

**Widening:**
- Globalization (benefits elites, harms workers)
- Race to the bottom (labor standards, environmental regulations)
- Tax havens (wealthy evade, poor countries lose revenue)

**Resistance:**
- Anti-globalization movements (Seattle WTO protests 1999)
- Fair trade, local food, ethical consumption

### Loss of Sovereignty

**States:**
- Constrained (by corporations, international institutions)
- Unable to regulate (capital flows, tax evasion)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is globalization making the world more homogeneous or more diverse?

**Question 2:** Can there be a just globalization?

**Question 3:** What is lost and what is gained in transnational lives?

**Question 4:** Is globalization inevitable or can it be resisted?

**Question 5:** How does globalization affect your own life?
