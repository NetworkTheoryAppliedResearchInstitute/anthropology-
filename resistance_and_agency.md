# Resistance and Agency: The Politics of the Subordinate

---

## Beyond Rulers: The Politics of Everyday Life

Political anthropology long focused on **leaders, institutions, states**. But what about **the ruled**?

**Questions:**
- How do subordinate people resist?
- What forms does resistance take?
- Is resistance always overt (rebellion)?
- How do people navigate power?
- What is agency under domination?

**Key Insight (James Scott, Abu-Lughod, Ortner):** Politics happens in everyday life, not just in formal arenas. Resistance takes many forms, most subtle.

## James C. Scott: "Weapons of the Weak" (1985)

### The Setting

**Malaysian Peasant Village (1970s-80s):**

**Context:**
- Green Revolution (mechanized farming)
- Rich farmers benefit
- Poor farmers lose jobs (machines replace labor)
- Growing inequality

**Open Rebellion?** No.

**But:** Constant, covert resistance.

### Everyday Resistance

**Scott's Discovery:** Peasants resist constantly, but **subtly**.

**Forms of Resistance:**

**1. Foot-Dragging:**
- Work slowly
- "I don't understand"
- Delay, procrastinate
- Minimal compliance

**2. Dissimulation:**
- Pretend ignorance
- Play dumb
- Feign deference
- Strategic incompetence

**3. False Compliance:**
- Appear obedient
- Actually subverting
- "Yes boss" (then don't do it)

**4. Pilfering:**
- Small thefts
- "They owe us"
- Redistributive justice
- Taking back

**5. Sabotage:**
- Break machines "accidentally"
- Damage property
- Slow down production
- Subtle harm

**6. Gossip and Slander:**
- Undermine elite reputation
- Spread damaging stories
- Mock behind backs
- Symbolic attack

**7. Evasion:**
- Avoid taxes (hide harvest)
- Flee obligations
- Disappear when needed
- Passive avoidance

**8. Poaching and Gleaning:**
- Use "forbidden" resources
- Reclaim commons
- Ignore property rights
- Silent appropriation

### Why Everyday Resistance?

**Not Rebellion Because:**
- Risky (violent repression)
- Poor organizing
- Surveillance
- Limited resources
- Ideological domination

**Everyday Resistance:**
- Low risk
- Individual or small group
- No formal organization needed
- Cumulative impact
- Constant, persistent

**Scott's Argument:**
- Everyday resistance more common than rebellion
- More important historically
- "Quiet encroachment" (Bayat)
- Doesn't overthrow, but limits exploitation

### Hidden vs. Public Transcripts

**Scott's Later Work: "Domination and the Arts of Resistance" (1990)**

**Public Transcript:**
- What subordinates say publicly
- Performance of deference
- Conform to power's discourse
- "Official story"

**Hidden Transcript:**
- What subordinates say offstage
- Backstage discourse
- Rage, critique, mockery
- Private resistance

**Examples:**

**Public:**
- Slave to master: "Yes master, right away master"
- Peasant to lord: "Of course, sir, as you wish"

**Hidden:**
- Slave quarters: "That man is evil, someday..."
- Peasant home: "Those parasites, living off our sweat"

**Function:**
- Safety valve
- Maintain dignity
- Prepare for resistance
- Build solidarity

**When Hidden Becomes Public:**
- Carnivals, festivals (temporary reversal)
- Rumors and folktales
- Coded speech
- Sometimes—rebellion

### Critique of Scott

**1. Romanticization?**
- Does everyday resistance actually change anything?
- Or just lets system continue?
- "Safety valve" that prevents real resistance?

**2. Agency Overemphasized?**
- Ignores structural constraints
- People resist but still dominated
- False consciousness?

**3. Defining Resistance:**
- Is everything resistance?
- Or some actions just survival?
- Conceptual inflation

**4. Gender Blind:**
- Mostly about male peasants
- Women's resistance different

**But Influential:**
- Shifted attention to subordinate agency
- Showed politics in everyday life
- Inspired ethnographies

## Gendered Resistance

### Lila Abu-Lughod: "The Romance of Resistance" (1990)

**Bedouin Women (Egypt):**

**Domination:**
- Patriarchy, gender segregation
- Male authority
- Constraints on women

**Resistance:**
- Poetry (ghinnawas)
- Express forbidden emotions (love, desire)
- Subvert honor code
- Private, among women

**But Also Compliance:**
- Uphold modesty norms
- Participate in system
- Not simple resistance

**Abu-Lughod's Argument:**
- Resistance and compliance intertwined
- "Romance of resistance" (anthropologists romanticize)
- Focus on resistance can miss complexity
- People both resist AND reproduce domination

**Better Question:** How do people negotiate power? (Not just resist)

### Women's Tactics

**Global Ethnographies:**

**1. Control of Sexuality/Reproduction:**
- Abortion, contraception (secret)
- Sexual refusal
- Strategic pregnancies

**2. Economic:**
- Hidden income
- Secret savings
- Control of markets

**3. Gossip and Reputation:**
- Undermine men's honor
- Spread rumors
- Social control

**4. Religious:**
- Spirit possession (legitimate "madness")
- Prophecy, mediumship
- Authority through sacred

**5. Networks:**
- Women's solidarity
- Mutual aid
- Collective resistance

> **Example: Mombasa Swahili Women**
>
> **Gill Shepherd:**
> - Spirit possession (pepo)
> - Women become possessed
> - Demands on husbands (gifts, attention)
> - Legitimated by spirits
> - Indirect power

> **Example: Algerian Women (Colonial)**
>
> **Frantz Fanon:**
> - Veiling as resistance
> - Concealing weapons
> - Subverting French unveiling campaigns
> - Reclaiming modesty

## Subaltern Studies and Postcolonial Critique

### Ranajit Guha and Subaltern Studies

**Subaltern = Subordinate (Gramsci):**
- Peasants, workers, colonized
- Excluded from elite history

**Project:**
- Write history from below
- Recover subaltern agency
- Challenge elite narratives

**Indian Peasant Rebellions:**
- Not just "mindless violence"
- Political consciousness
- Sophisticated strategies
- Autonomous politics

**Influence on Anthropology:**
- Attend to subordinate voices
- Challenge elite perspectives
- Agency of colonized

### Gayatri Spivak: "Can the Subaltern Speak?" (1988)

**Critique:**
- Subaltern voice mediated by elites
- Anthropologists speak FOR subalterns
- "Native informant" problem
- Epistemic violence

**Sati (Widow Burning) Example:**
- British "save brown women from brown men"
- Nationalist men "women really want it"
- **Woman's voice absent**

**Challenge:**
- How to represent without appropriating?
- Collaborative methods
- Reflexivity

---

## Everyday Politics Beyond Resistance

### Michel de Certeau: "The Practice of Everyday Life" (1984)

**Not Just Resistance:**
- Tactics vs. strategies
- **Strategies:** Powerful deploy (states, corporations)
- **Tactics:** Weak use (consumers, subordinates)

**Tactics:**
- Improvisation
- Making do
- Poaching (using differently than intended)
- Creativity in constraints

**Examples:**
- Listening to personal music at work
- Using office supplies
- Reinterpreting rules
- Small freedoms

**Not Resistance (Necessarily):**
- Just living, navigating
- Agency ≠ always resistance

**Anthropology:**
- People creatively navigate
- Not determined by structures
- Not simply resisting

### Saba Mahmood: "Politics of Piety" (2005)

**Egyptian Women's Mosque Movement:**

**Question:** Are veiling, piety, submission resistance or compliance?

**Mahmood's Answer:** Neither/both—different framework.

**Women's Agency:**
- Cultivate piety (Islamic virtues)
- Ethical self-fashioning
- Agency through submission to God
- Not resisting patriarchy—transforming selves

**Challenge:**
- Western assumptions (agency = autonomy, resistance)
- Islamic framework different
- Agency can be non-liberal

**Implication:**
- Don't impose Western concepts of resistance
- Multiple forms of agency
- Cultural specificity

## Protest and Social Movements

### Overt Resistance

**Beyond Everyday:**
- Protests, strikes, rebellions
- Organized movements
- Public confrontation

**Anthropology Studies:**
- Social movements ethnographically
- How mobilized?
- Meanings, symbols, identities
- Networks, tactics

### Examples

> **Zapatista Movement (Mexico)**
>
> **1994 Uprising:**
> - Indigenous Chiapas
> - EZLN (Zapatista Army)
> - Armed rebellion
> - "We are here!"
> - Land rights, autonomy
>
> **Anthropological Studies:**
> - Identity politics
> - Transnational solidarity
> - Autonomous communities
> - Critique of neoliberalism

> **Occupy Movement (2011)**
>
> **Global:**
> - "We are the 99%"
> - Occupy Wall Street, etc.
> - Critique inequality
> - Prefigurative politics (model alternatives)
>
> **Anthropologists Studied:**
> - Horizontal organizing
> - General assemblies
> - Consensus decision-making
> - Limits and tensions

> **Arab Spring (2010-2011)**
>
> **Multiple Countries:**
> - Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, etc.
> - Overthrow dictators (some)
> - Social media role
>
> **Anthropology:**
> - Youth culture
> - Tahrir Square ethnography
> - Revolution as process
> - Outcomes varied

### Social Movement Theory

**Anthropological Contributions:**

**1. Meanings Matter:**
- Not just material interests
- Identity, culture, symbols
- Framing processes

**2. Networks and Kinship:**
- Movements build on existing ties
- Kinship mobilizes
- Trust networks

**3. Rituals and Performance:**
- Protests as ritual
- Chants, symbols
- Create solidarity

**4. Emotions:**
- Moral outrage
- Hope, fear
- Emotional communities

## Infrapolitics and Quiet Encroachment

### Asef Bayat: "Life as Politics" (2010)

**Middle Eastern Urban Poor:**

**Infrapolitics:**
- Below formal politics
- Individualized, quiet
- No organization
- Cumulative impact

**Quiet Encroachment:**
- Informal housing (squatting)
- Street vending
- Pirating utilities (electricity, water)
- Using public space

**Not Organized Movement:**
- Individuals acting
- But collectively significant
- State must respond
- Gradual transformation

**Examples:**
- Cairo informal settlements
- Tehran street vendors
- Constant negotiation with state

**Bayat's Argument:**
- This is politics
- Changes cities, societies
- More important than formal politics for many
- "Politics of presence"

## Agency Under Extreme Domination

### Slavery

**How to Resist When Owned?**

**Eugene Genovese, "Roll, Jordan, Roll" (1974):**

**US Slavery:**
- Spirituals (coded resistance)
- Slowdowns, sabotage
- Running away
- Poison masters
- Revolt (rare but happened)

**But Also:**
- Paternalism accepted (sometimes)
- Accommodation
- Survival strategies

**Debate:** Accommodation vs. resistance?

**Both:** People navigate impossible situations creatively.

### Concentration Camps

**Viktor Frankl, Primo Levi:**

**Extreme Domination:**
- Nazi camps, gulags
- Total control
- Dehumanization

**Still:**
- Small resistances (mental, spiritual)
- Mutual aid
- Preserving humanity
- Witness, testimony

**Anthropology:**
- Agency persists even in extremity
- Human creativity, dignity

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is everyday resistance meaningful change, or does it just sustain oppression?

**Question 2:** Can we identify resistance without imposing our values on others?

**Question 3:** Is all agency resistance, or are some actions just survival?

**Question 4:** Do hidden transcripts matter if they don't become public?

**Question 5:** How do we respect subaltern agency without romanticizing their oppression?

**Remember:** Resistance isn't just rebellion—it's everyday, subtle, constant. Foot-dragging, gossip, sabotage, pilfering—these are the "weapons of the weak." People maintain hidden transcripts, performpublic deference while privately critiquing. But romanticizing resistance is problematic—people also accommodate, comply, navigate. Agency isn't always resistance; sometimes it's piety, survival, or just living. Understanding subordinate politics requires listening to subaltern voices, recognizing multiple forms of agency, avoiding imposing Western concepts. From Malaysian peasants to Egyptian women to informal urban dwellers, people exercise agency creatively within constraints. Politics happens everywhere, not just in formal institutions—in kitchens, fields, streets, everyday life.
