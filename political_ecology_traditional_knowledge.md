# Environmental Anthropology: Political Ecology and Traditional Knowledge

---

## Political Ecology

### Definition and Foundations

**Political Ecology:**
- Studies environment-society relations (power, politics, political economy)
- NOT just ecology (biological)
- Politics matters (who benefits, who decides, who bears costs)
- Scale (local practices ↔ global forces)

**Origins:**
- 1970s-1980s
- Critique of apolitical environmental science
- Influenced by: Marxist political economy, cultural ecology, postcolonial studies

**Key Insight:**
- Environmental degradation ≠ neutral process
- Shaped by power relations (colonialism, capitalism, state policies)
- Marginalized people (often blamed, but structural causes)

---

## Eric Wolf

### Europe and the People Without History

**Europe and the People Without History** (1982):
- NOT specifically environmental, but foundational
- Global capitalism (connects "primitive" to modern)
- No isolated societies (all connected through colonialism, trade)

**Political Ecology:**
- Wolf influenced (world systems, political economy)
- Environment can't be studied locally only (global connections)

---

## Piers Blaikie and Harold Brookfield

### Land Degradation and Society

**Land Degradation and Society** (1987):
- Foundational political ecology text

**Argument:**
- Land degradation (soil erosion, deforestation) = political-economic
- NOT caused by: Overpopulation, ignorance, "traditional" practices
- Caused by: Colonialism, capitalism, marginalization, poverty
  - Poor farmers pushed to marginal lands (steep slopes, fragile soils)
  - Must overexploit to survive
  - Elites control best lands

**Chain of Explanation:**
- Local practices ← regional economy ← national policies ← global economy
- Example: Nepali farmers (soil erosion)
  - Blamed for deforestation (cutting trees, farming slopes)
  - Reality: Landlessness, poverty, no alternatives
  - Elites control valleys (farmers pushed to mountains)

---

## Michael Painter and William Durham

### Political Ecology of Deforestation

**Example Studies:**

**Honduras (William Durham):**
- *Scarcity and Survival in Central America* (1979)
- Land inequality (elites own best land, cattle ranching)
- Peasants (pushed to forests, slash-and-burn)
- "Soccer War" (1969, El Salvador-Honduras)
  - Framed as overpopulation
  - Actually: Land inequality, Salvadoran refugees fleeing landlessness

**Amazonia (Various scholars):**
- Deforestation blamed on: Indigenous shifting cultivation, peasant settlers
- Political ecology: Cattle ranching (elites), logging (corporations), roads (state development)
- Peasants (pawns, clearing land then displaced by ranchers)

---

## Dianne Rocheleau

### Feminist Political Ecology

**"Feminist Political Ecology"** (1996, with Barbara Thomas-Slayter, Esther Wangari):
- Gender and environment

**Argument:**
- Women ≠ "closer to nature" (essentialist, problematic)
- BUT: Gendered divisions of labor (women often responsible for fuel, water, food)
- Environmental degradation (affects women disproportionately)
  - Longer walks for firewood, water
  - Food security (women farmers)
- Knowledge (women's ecological knowledge, often ignored)
- Decision-making (excluded, male-dominated)

**Examples:**
- Kenya: Women tree planters (Green Belt Movement, Wangari Maathai, Nobel Peace Prize 2004)
- Agroforestry (women's practices, sustainable)

---

## Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)

### Indigenous Knowledge

**Definition:**
- Local, indigenous knowledge about environment
- Accumulated over generations (oral transmission)
- Holistic (integrated with culture, spirituality, social organization)

**Characteristics:**
- Place-based (specific ecosystems)
- Detailed (species identification, behavior, uses)
- Adaptive (experimentation, learning)
- Sustainable (often, but not always romanticized)

**Examples:**
- Inuit (Arctic, ice conditions, animal behavior, navigation)
- Aboriginal Australians (fire management, plant uses, water sources)
- Amazonian peoples (plant taxonomy, medicinal uses, forest management)
- Pacific Islanders (navigation, star knowledge, ocean patterns)

---

## Fikret Berkes

### Sacred Ecology

**Sacred Ecology** (1999, multiple editions):
- Comprehensive overview (TEK)

**Argument:**
- TEK ≠ primitive, inferior
- Complementary to Western science (different, not lesser)
- Integration (TEK + science = better environmental management)

**Examples:**
- Cree hunters (James Bay, Canada)
  - Animal populations (sustained yield, reciprocity)
  - Knowledge (animal behavior, habitat, cyclical patterns)
- Coral reef management (Pacific)
  - Traditional marine tenure (customary sea rights)
  - Taboos (*tapu*, seasonal closures)
  - Sustainable fishing

**Challenges:**
- Documentation (oral, can be lost)
- Romanticization (not all traditional practices sustainable)
- Intellectual property (who owns knowledge? Biopiracy)

---

## Eugene Hunn

### Columbia Plateau

**Nch'i-Wána "The Big River"** (1990):
- Columbia River Plateau (Pacific Northwest, U.S.)
- Sahaptin-speaking peoples

**Ethnobiology:**
- Detailed plant and animal knowledge
- Classification systems (folk taxonomy)
- Ecological zones (named, managed)
- Resource use (salmon, roots, berries, seasonal rounds)

**Argument:**
- TEK = sophisticated, scientific (in its own right)
- Observation, experimentation, transmission

---

## Arun Agrawal

### Environmentality

**Environmentalities** (2005):
- Kumaon, India (Himalayas, forest management)

**Concept:**
- "Environmentality" (Foucault's governmentality + environment)
- Subjects formed (people become "environmental subjects")
- Community forestry (India, Nepal)
  - Devolution (state transfers management to communities)
  - Creates environmental identities, responsibilities

**Argument:**
- NOT simply "community control" (romantic, empowering)
- Also: Disciplining (communities must manage "properly")
- Governs conduct (internalize conservation norms)
- Ambivalent (empowerment AND regulation)

---

## Conservation and Conflict

### Fortress Conservation

**Fortress Conservation:**
- Protected areas (national parks, reserves)
- Exclusion (people removed, prohibited from use)
- "Wilderness" ideal (nature without people)
- Colonial legacy (imposed on indigenous lands)

**History:**
- Yellowstone (U.S., 1872, first national park)
  - Native Americans expelled (hunting, living prohibited)
- Africa (colonial parks, expelled pastoralists, hunters)
- Global (replicated worldwide)

**Critiques:**
- Dispossesses people (livelihoods destroyed)
- Ignores indigenous management (landscapes shaped by people for millennia)
- "Pristine wilderness" = myth (humans everywhere, historically)
- Ineffective (local opposition, poaching, resentment)

---

## Roderick Neumann

### Tanzania

**Imposing Wilderness** (1998):
- Northern Tanzania (Arusha National Park, Meru)

**Argument:**
- Park creation (colonial, dispossessed Meru people)
- "Wilderness" (produced, not discovered)
- Evictions (1950s, Meru farmers removed)
- Resistance (protests, legal challenges, lost)
- Tourism (benefits elites, excludes locals)

**Legacy:**
- Post-colonial state (continued exclusion)
- People vs. parks (antagonistic)

---

## Nancy Peluso

### Indonesia

**Rich Forests, Poor People** (1992):
- Java, Indonesia (teak forests, colonial forestry)

**Argument:**
- State control (forests declared state property, colonial era)
- Criminalization (local use = illegal, poaching)
- "Violent environmentalism" (coercion, enforcement)
- Resistance ("forest crimes," sabotage, defiance)

**Political forests:**
- Forests ≠ nature (contested, political)
- Access and control (struggles)

---

## Community-Based Conservation

### Alternative Approach

**Community-Based Conservation (CBC):**
- Local communities (partners, not enemies)
- Resource use (sustainable harvest allowed, incentivize conservation)
- Benefits (communities gain from conservation, tourism revenue, employment)

**Examples:**
- CAMPFIRE (Zimbabwe, Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources)
  - Wildlife management (communities, revenue from trophy hunting)
  - Mixed results (elite capture, unequal distribution)
- Community forests (Nepal, India, Mexico)
  - Local management (committees, rules, monitoring)
  - Variable success

**Critiques:**
- "Community" (assumes homogeneous, but internal inequality, power)
- Neoliberal (responsibilize communities, withdraw state support)
- Romantic (not all communities want conservation)

---

## James Fairhead and Melissa Leach

### Guinea

**Misreading the African Landscape** (1996):
- Guinea (West Africa, forest islands)

**Argument:**
- Colonial assumption: Forest patches = remnants (degradation, deforestation by people)
- Reality: Created by people (agroforestry, intentional planting around villages)
- **Inversion:** People make forests, not destroy them
- Demonstrates: Narratives matter (misreading = bad policy)

**Implications:**
- Environmental narratives (often wrong, colonial legacy)
- Question assumptions (degradation, population, indigenous practices)

---

## Michael Dove

### Political Economy of Conservation

**"The Political Ecology of Social Movements"** (2006, article, edited volume):
- Social movements (environmental, indigenous rights)

**Conservation and Inequality:**
- Who bears costs? (locals, displaced, restricted)
- Who gains benefits? (tourists, elites, global North)
- Environmental justice (unequal distribution)

**Examples:**
- Rainforest conservation (indigenous peoples restricted, but carbon credits sold)
- Ecotourism (revenue to corporations, not communities)

---

## Arturo Escobar

### Encountering Development

**Encountering Development** (1995):
- Critique of development (post-development)

**Argument:**
- Development discourse (constructs Third World as backward, needing intervention)
- Environmental development (sustainable development, still top-down, Western)
- Alternatives (local, indigenous, pluriverse)

**Political Ecology:**
- Development projects (dams, plantations, conservation) = displacement, marginalization

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is traditional ecological knowledge "science"?

**Question 2:** Can fortress conservation ever be just?

**Question 3:** Is community-based conservation empowering or neoliberal responsibilization?

**Question 4:** Who has the right to define "environmental degradation"?

**Question 5:** Can nature and people coexist in protected areas?
