# The Formalist vs. Substantivist Debate: How to Study Economy

---

## The Central Question

**Can Western economic theory (based on markets, scarcity, rational choice) explain ALL economies? Or are non-market economies fundamentally different?**

This debate dominated economic anthropology from 1940s-1970s and still shapes the field.

**Two Camps:**

**Formalists:** Yes—universal principles apply everywhere.

**Substantivists:** No—market economies are historically specific; non-market economies need different frameworks.

**At Stake:**
- How to study economic behavior
- Whether "economics" is universal
- Relationship between anthropology and economics
- Nature of human rationality

---

## Formalist Position

### Core Argument

**Economy = Economizing:**
- Allocating scarce means to alternative ends
- Rational choice under constraints
- Maximizing utility/profit
- Universal human behavior

**All Societies:**
- Face scarcity
- Make choices
- Have preferences
- Maximize something

**Therefore:** Same analytical tools (supply, demand, marginal utility, cost-benefit) apply everywhere.

### Key Assumptions

**1. Scarcity is Universal:**
- Resources always limited
- Wants exceed means
- Must choose

**2. Rational Choice:**
- People weigh costs and benefits
- Choose optimally
- Consistent preferences

**3. Individual Agency:**
- Individuals make decisions
- Aggregate to macro patterns

**4. Formal Models Apply:**
- Supply and demand curves
- Marginal analysis
- Optimization models
- Game theory (later)

### Proponents

**Raymond Firth (1950s-60s):**

**"Primitive Polynesian Economy" (1939):**
- Tikopia islanders
- Applied economic analysis
- Found rational choice
- Supply and demand operate

**Argument:**
- Even without markets, people economize
- Limited fish, must allocate time
- Rational calculations
- Universal rationality

**Harold Schneider:**
- Studied East African pastoralists
- Cattle as capital investment
- Maximizing behavior
- Economic models work

**Scott Cook (1960s):**
- Defended formalism
- All societies face scarcity
- Choice is universal
- Anthropology should use economic theory

### Strengths

**1. Parsimony:**
- Single framework for all economies
- Simpler than multiple theories

**2. Comparative:**
- Can compare across societies
- Measure efficiency
- Quantitative analysis possible

**3. Predictive:**
- Formal models make predictions
- Testable hypotheses

**4. Links to Economics:**
- Dialogue with mainstream economics
- Policy relevance

### Problems

**1. Assumes What Should Be Proven:**
- That people everywhere maximize
- Preference assumption questionable
- Rationality culturally specific?

**2. Ignores Social Embedding:**
- Economy separate from society
- But Polanyi showed embedding crucial

**3. Ethnocentric:**
- Projects Western rationality globally
- Market assumptions where no markets

**4. Misses Meaning:**
- Quantitative focus
- Ignores cultural values, meanings
- Reduces complexity

## Substantivist Position

### Core Argument

**Economy = Provisioning:**
- How society provisions itself
- Material means of existence
- Embedded in social institutions

**Market Economies ≠ All Economies:**
- Modern markets historically specific
- Non-market societies organized differently
- Can't use market concepts

**Therefore:** Need culturally specific analysis—understand each economy in own terms.

### Key Assumptions

**1. Economy is Embedded:**
- Integrated with kinship, politics, religion
- Not separate sphere
- Social relationships govern exchange

**2. Multiple Economic Logics:**
- Reciprocity, redistribution, market = different logics
- Not reducible to one model

**3. Cultural Variability:**
- Goals differ across societies
- Prestige, not profit
- Survival, not accumulation
- Culturally specific rationalities

**4. Historical Specificity:**
- Market capitalism is recent
- Substantive economy broader concept
- Most human history ≠ markets

### Proponents

**Karl Polanyi (1944):**

**"The Great Transformation":**

**Economy has TWO meanings:**

**Formal:** Economizing, rational choice (formalist definition)

**Substantive:** Provisioning, material existence (substantivist definition)

**Formal meaning ONLY applies to market economies.**

**Non-market economies:**
- Embedded in society
- Reciprocity and redistribution
- Not profit-maximizing
- Different logic

**Three Integration Forms:**
- Reciprocity (social symmetry)
- Redistribution (centricity)
- Market exchange (supply-demand)

**Market society = disembedded (false assumption markets can be self-regulating).**

**George Dalton (1960s-70s):**

**Strongest substantivist:**

**Argued:**
- Formalists commit "economistic fallacy"
- Project market assumptions onto non-market societies
- Misunderstand fundamentally different systems

**"Primitive, Archaic, and Modern Economies" (1968):**
- Edited Polanyi's essays
- Championed substantivist approach
- Critiqued formalist ethnocentrism

**Marshall Sahlins (1960s-70s):**

**"Stone Age Economics" (1972):**

**"Original Affluent Society":**
- Hunter-gatherers not poor
- Work few hours
- Needs easily met
- Affluent (wants < means, not means > wants)

**Challenges scarcity assumption:**
- Scarcity culturally produced
- Market economy creates wants
- Not universal condition

**Domestic Mode of Production:**
- Households underproducing
- Not maximizing
- Social limits on production
- Contradicts optimization models

### Strengths

**1. Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Respects local meanings
- Doesn't impose outside frameworks
- Ethnographic depth

**2. Holistic:**
- Economy integrated with society
- Context matters
- Complexity preserved

**3. Historical:**
- Recognizes variability over time
- Market capitalism = historical anomaly
- Not teleological

**4. Critical:**
- Questions universality of capitalism
- Challenges naturalizing markets
- Political implications

### Problems

**1. Relativism:**
- If each economy unique, how compare?
- No general theory possible?

**2. Romanticization:**
- Can idealize non-market societies
- "Noble savage" problem
- Ignores conflict, inequality

**3. Overstates Difference:**
- All societies have some calculation
- Choice exists everywhere
- Dichotomy too stark?

**4. Limits Policy Application:**
- Hard to derive practical recommendations
- Less predictive

## The Debate in Practice

### Example: Bride Wealth

**Question:** How to understand bridewealth (cattle/goods given for marriage)?

**Formalist Answer:**
- Market transaction
- Supply and demand for wives
- Maximize marriage alliances
- Investment in lineage labor

**Substantivist Answer:**
- Creates social relationships between lineages
- Not commodity exchange
- Embedded in kinship
- Meaning matters, not just material value

**Who's Right?**
- Both have insights
- Formalist: rational calculation occurs
- Substantivist: but meaning is social, not economic

### Example: Potlatch

**Formalist:**
- Status maximization
- Investment in prestige
- Strategic competition
- Rational actor model

**Substantivist:**
- Total social phenomenon
- Political, religious, economic together
- Can't reduce to optimization
- Cultural logic specific

**Debate:**
- Can formalist models capture potlatch?
- Or is substantivist framework necessary?

### Example: Peasant Economy

**Formalist (Theodore Schultz):**
- Peasants are rational
- "Poor but Efficient"
- Allocate resources optimally
- Could be more productive if markets work

**Substantivist (James Scott):**
- "Moral Economy of the Peasant"
- Subsistence ethic, not profit
- Safety-first strategy
- Social obligations constrain

**Policy Implications:**
- Formalist: Free markets help peasants
- Substantivist: Markets destroy subsistence security

## Beyond the Debate

### Why It Faded (1970s+)

**1. Stalemate:**
- Neither side convinced other
- Talking past each other
- Empirical evidence ambiguous

**2. New Approaches:**
- Marxist anthropology (political economy)
- Feminist anthropology (gender and economy)
- Practice theory (Bourdieu)
- World-systems theory

**3. Changed Questions:**
- Less "are they rational?" 
- More "how does capitalism transform?"
- Globalization, development, inequality

**4. Rapprochement:**
- Both sides have truth
- Need synthesis

### Synthesis Attempts

**Economic Anthropology Textbooks (Stone, Halperin):**
- Present both approaches
- Context-dependent
- Some situations—formalist tools useful
- Other situations—substantivist necessary

**Behavioral Economics:**
- People rational but bounded
- Heuristics, biases, cultural frames
- Bridges formal models and cultural specificity

**New Institutional Economics:**
- Institutions matter (Polanyi-esque)
- But still formal models
- Transaction costs, property rights

**Practice Theory (Bourdieu):**
- Strategy within structures
- Habitus = embodied rationality (culturally specific)
- Capital beyond economic
- Synthesis?

## Contemporary Relevance

### Neoliberalism Debates

**Formalist Logic:**
- Rational actors
- Free markets efficient
- Self-regulating
- Universal application

**Substantivist Critique:**
- Markets disembedded
- Social costs
- Inequality
- Culture matters

**David Harvey, Arturo Escobar:**
- Use Polanyi to critique neoliberalism
- Embed economy
- Resist market fundamentalism

### Development Economics

**Formalist Approach:**
- Get incentives right
- Market solutions
- Rational peasants

**Substantivist/Critical:**
- Development destroys livelihoods
- Moral economies matter
- Resist commodification
- Alternative economies

**James Ferguson:**
- "Anti-Politics Machine"
- Development projects fail because ignore social embedding
- Technical solutions to political problems

### Informal Economies

**Global South majority:**

**How to understand?**

**Formalist:** Rational actors in difficult constraints (De Soto)

**Substantivist:** Alternative to capitalism, embedded in social networks

**Reality:** Probably both—strategic and social.

## Key Insights from the Debate

**1. Definition Matters:**
- What you mean by "economy" shapes analysis
- Formal vs. substantive definitions

**2. Context is Crucial:**
- Market vs. non-market contexts different
- Historical specificity

**3. Culture Shapes Rationality:**
- Not universal rationality
- Culturally specific goals and means

**4. Both/And, Not Either/Or:**
- People calculate AND are embedded socially
- Strategy AND structure
- Universal AND particular

**5. Political Stakes:**
- How you theorize economy affects policy
- Naturalize markets OR critique them?

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are you convinced by formalists or substantivists? Why?

**Question 2:** Can you think of economic behavior in your life that's embedded socially (substantivist) vs. purely rational choice (formalist)?

**Question 3:** Is Sahlins right that hunter-gatherers were affluent? Or does that romanticize hardship?

**Question 4:** Should development policy assume rational actors (formalist) or culturally specific economies (substantivist)?

**Question 5:** Has neoliberalism won the debate by making formalist assumptions globally dominant?

**Remember:** The formalist-substantivist debate shaped economic anthropology. Formalists said universal economic principles apply; substantivists said economies are culturally embedded and historically specific. Both have insights. Formalist tools useful for some questions (allocation, optimization). Substantivist frameworks essential for understanding meaning, social context, cultural difference. The debate revealed political stakes—how we theorize economy affects how we understand capitalism, development, globalization. Contemporary anthropology synthesizes insights from both, recognizing people strategize within culturally specific structures. The debate's legacy: economy is never just economy—it's always social, cultural, political, historical.
