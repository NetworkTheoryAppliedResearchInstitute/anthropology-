# Myth and Cosmology: Stories of Origins and Cosmic Order

---

## What Is Myth?

**Common Usage:** "Myth" = false story, superstition

**Anthropological Usage:** Myth = sacred narrative

**Characteristics:**
- Set in primordial time ("dreamtime," "time of origins")
- Concerns gods, ancestors, creation
- Explains how things came to be
- Sacred, not simply entertainment
- Provides models for human behavior
- Often ritual accompaniment

**Not:**
- Deliberately false
- Just "primitive science"
- Only entertainment

**Functions:**
- Explain origins
- Charter social institutions
- Provide meaning
- Connect humans to cosmos
- Justify present order

## Theoretical Approaches to Myth

### Malinowski: Myth as Charter

**"Myth in Primitive Psychology" (1926)**

**Argument:**
- Myth is not intellectual exercise
- **Practical function**
- Validates social institutions
- Charters present practices

**Trobriand Example:**
- Myths explain clan origins
- Why particular clans have land rights
- Legitimize current hierarchy
- "This is how it has always been"

**Function:**
- Justifies status quo
- Makes social order sacred
- Prevents questioning

**Critique:**
- Functionalist (assumes harmony)
- Ignores change, contestation
- Myths can also critique status quo

### Lévi-Strauss: Myth as Logical Structure

**"Structural Anthropology" (1963), "The Raw and the Cooked" (1964)**

**Structuralism:**
- Myths express universal mental structures
- Binary oppositions
- Mediating contradictions

**How Myths Work:**
- Present binary oppositions
  - Nature/Culture
  - Life/Death
  - Male/Female
  - Raw/Cooked
- Provide mediation (impossible resolution)
- Transform one opposition into another

**Example: Oedipus Myth (Lévi-Strauss's Analysis)**

**Oppositions:**
- Undervaluing blood relations (Oedipus kills father)
- Overvaluing blood relations (Oedipus marries mother)
- Autochthony (born from earth) vs. human reproduction

**Mediates:**
- Where do humans come from?
- If from earth, why born from woman?
- Myth can't resolve, but transforms

**Amazon Myths (Extensive Analysis):**
- Hundreds of variations
- All playing with same structural themes
- Transformations reveal underlying logic

**Critique:**
- Too abstract
- Ignores meaning to people
- Assumes universal mind
- Ahistorical

**But Influential:** Pattern-finding, comparison

### Eliade: Myth as Sacred Time

**"The Sacred and the Profane" (1957), "Myth and Reality" (1963)**

**Myth Returns to Sacred Time:**
- Profane time (linear, everyday)
- Sacred time (cyclical, eternal, mythic)
- Ritual reenacts myth
- Returns to origins
- Renews cosmos

**"Eternal Return":**
- Ritual repetition
- Abolishes profane time
- Regenerates world

**Example:**
- Australian Aboriginals re-enact Dreamtime
- Becomes contemporaneous with ancestors
- World renewed

**Critique:**
- Essentializes "archaic" societies
- Static view
- But insight: myth and ritual linked temporally

## Cosmology: Ordering the Universe

### What Is Cosmology?

**Cosmology = Worldview:**
- How universe structured
- Realms (sky, earth, underworld)
- Beings (gods, spirits, humans, animals)
- Forces, principles
- Moral order

**Not Just "Beliefs":**
- Lived experience
- Shapes perception
- Guides action

### Cosmological Structures

**Common Patterns (Not Universal):**

**Vertical:**
- Sky/Heaven (gods, celestial)
- Earth (humans)
- Underworld (dead, chthonic)

**Horizontal:**
- Center (sacred)
- Periphery (profane, dangerous)
- Cardinal directions

**Temporal:**
- Cycles (day/night, seasons, ages)
- Linear (creation → end)
- Eternal return

**But Enormous Variation.**

### Examples of Cosmologies

> **Dogon (Mali) - Marcel Griaule**
>
> **Complex Cosmology:**
> - Creation by Amma (god)
> - Nommo (ancestors) descended
> - Universe as spiral
> - Granary = cosmos
> - Everything corresponds (microcosm/macrocosm)
> - Numbers, symbols
>
> **Critique:**
> - Griaule may have imposed structure
> - Informant (Ogotemmêli) atypical
> - Debated authenticity

> **Balinese Cosmology (Geertz, Lansing)**
>
> **Kaja-Kelod (Mountain-Sea):**
> - Sacred mountains (kaja, upstream)
> - Profane sea (kelod, downstream)
> - Temples aligned
> - Bodies oriented
> - Houses structured
>
> **Subak (Irrigation Societies):**
> - J. Stephen Lansing
> - Water temple networks
> - Coordinate rice planting
> - Cosmology and ecology integrated
> - Balance, harmony

> **Maori Cosmology**
>
> **Ranginui and Papatūānuku:**
> - Sky father and Earth mother
> - Embracing, darkness
> - Children push apart
> - Light, world created
> - Genealogies (whakapapa) trace to gods
> - All beings related

> **Navajo (Diné)**
>
> **Hózhǫ́ (Balance, Beauty, Harmony):**
> - Four sacred mountains bound Dinétah (homeland)
> - Four directions, colors
> - Emergence through worlds
> - Current world = Glittering World
> - Rituals restore hózhǫ́ when disrupted
> - Sandpaintings = cosmological maps

## Myth and Social Order

### Gender and Myth

**Many Myths Explain Gender Roles:**

## Cosmology and Ecology

### Indigenous Ecological Knowledge

**Cosmologies Encode Ecology:**

> - All beings see themselves as human
> - See others as animals/spirits
> - Perspective-dependent
> - Multinatural (not multicultural)
> - Ontological, not just epistemological
>
> **Implications:**
> - Respect for non-humans
> - Reciprocal relations
> - Not "resources" but persons

## Myth and History

### Are Myths Historical?

**Not Literal History:**
- Symbolic, sacred truth
- Different genre

**But Encode History:**
- Migrations, events
- Transformed symbolically

> **Example: Pacific Migrations**
>
> - Polynesian myths of voyages
> - Correspond to archaeological evidence
> - Encoded in genealogies

### Mythologizing History

**Recent Events Become Mythic:**

> **Melanesian Cargo Cults**
>
> - Prophets have visions
> - Ancestors will send cargo (Western goods)
> - Mythologize colonialism
> - Rituals to bring cargo
>
> **Anthropology:**
> - Not "irrationality"
> - Making sense of disruption
> - Creative mythology

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are modern "origin stories" (Big Bang, evolution) also "myths"?

**Question 2:** Can myths be "wrong" if they provide meaning?

**Question 3:** Do you have creation myths in your culture?

**Question 4:** Is Lévi-Strauss right that myths reveal universal mental structures?

**Question 5:** What role do stories play in your sense of identity and belonging?

- Ritual Theory ([[ritual_theory.md]])

**Ethnographic Cases:**
- Session 16: African, Asian, Indigenous American cosmologies in depth

**Classic Texts:**
- Malinowski, Bronislaw. (1926). *Myth in Primitive Psychology*
- Lévi-Strauss, Claude. (1963). *Structural Anthropology*
- Eliade, Mircea. (1954). *The Myth of the Eternal Return*

---

**Remember:** Myths aren't false stories—they're sacred narratives explaining origins, structuring cosmos, chartering social institutions. Malinowski saw myths as practical charters. Lévi-Strauss found universal structural logic. Eliade emphasized return to sacred time. Cosmologies are worldviews organizing universe vertically, horizontally, temporally. Creation myths vary (ex nihilo, earth diver, emergence, cosmic egg) but all explain how current world came to be. Myths can legitimize hierarchy (caste, gender) or encode ecology and history. Understanding myth reveals how humans create meaning, order chaos, connect to cosmos, and justify social arrangements. Myths aren't primitive science—they're powerful ways of being in the world.
