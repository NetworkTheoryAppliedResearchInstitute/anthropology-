# Reflexivity and Positionality: The Researcher in the Research

---

## You Are Part of Your Research

Traditional science aims for objectivity—the researcher as neutral, invisible observer who doesn't affect what's observed.

**Anthropology recognizes:** This is impossible.

**The anthropologist:**
- Has a particular social position (gender, race, class, nationality, etc.)
- Brings values, assumptions, biases
- Affects the field site by being there
- Interprets through their own cultural lens
- Has power (to represent, publish, benefit)

**Reflexivity** = critically examining your own position and how it shapes research.

**Not navel-gazing—it's essential methodological and ethical practice.**

## What Is Reflexivity?

### Definition

**Reflexivity:** Conscious awareness of how you (the researcher) shape the research process and findings.

**Involves Examining:**
- Your social position and identities
- Your assumptions and biases
- Your relationships in the field
- Your power and privilege
- How you affect what you observe
- How you interpret data
- Whose voices you amplify/silence
- What you see and what you miss

**The Goal:**
Not to eliminate bias (impossible) but to:
- Acknowledge it
- Account for it
- Make it visible to readers
- Mitigate problematic effects

### Levels of Reflexivity

**1. Personal Reflexivity:**
Who am I? What identities, experiences, values do I bring?

**2. Interpersonal Reflexivity:**
How do my relationships in the field shape data?

**3. Methodological Reflexivity:**
How do my methods affect findings?

**4. Epistemological Reflexivity:**
How do my assumptions about knowledge shape research?

**5. Political Reflexivity:**
How does power operate in my research relationships?

## Positionality: Who You Are Matters

### Your Social Location

**Aspects of Identity That Shape Research:**

**Gender:**
- Shapes access (what spaces you can enter)
- Affects rapport (who trusts you)
- Influences topics people discuss

**Race/Ethnicity:**
- Insider/outsider dynamics
- Racialized assumptions about you
- Different receptions in different communities

**Class:**
- Material differences (resources, lifestyle)
- Cultural capital
- Perceived privilege

**Nationality:**
- Colonial histories
- Global power dynamics
- Visa restrictions, permissions

**Age:**
- Authority or youth
- Generation gaps
- Life stage similarities

**Sexuality:**
- Who discusses what
- Assumed heteronormativity
- LGBTQ+ anthropologists' different access

**Language:**
- Fluency affects depth
- Accent marks you
- Multilingualism valuable

**Professional Status:**
- Student vs. professor
- Institutional affiliation
- Academic credentials

**Physical Ability:**
- Mobility affects access
- Disability visible or invisible

**Religion:**
- Shared or different
- Secular vs. religious
- Affects sacred access

### Insider/Outsider

**Insider Research:**
Studying your own community—shared identity, culture, language.

**Advantages:**
- Deep understanding
- Language fluency
- Cultural competence
- Trust easier
- Nuance and subtlety

**Challenges:**
- Too close—can't see patterns
- Assumptions taken for granted
- Difficult to ask "stupid" questions
- Conflicting loyalties
- Can't leave (community is home)

**Outsider Research:**
Studying different community.

**Advantages:**
- Fresh perspective
- Notice what's taken for granted
- Can ask naive questions
- Analytical distance

**Challenges:**
- Language barriers
- Cultural misunderstandings
- Trust harder to build
- Extractive potential
- Colonial dynamics

**Neither is "better"—both have strengths and limitations.**

**Often: Partial Insider/Outsider**
- Share some identities, not others
- Insider on gender, outsider on race
- Complicated positioning

### Example: How Gender Shapes Access

> **Male Anthropologist in Patriarchal Society:**
>
> **Access to:**
> - Men's spaces (mosques, councils, gatherings)
> - Public sphere
> - Political discussions
>
> **Limited Access to:**
> - Women's spaces (homes, women's gatherings)
> - Domestic sphere
> - Women's perspectives
>
> **Result:** Ethnography focuses on men's worlds.

> **Female Anthropologist, Same Society:**
>
> **Access to:**
> - Women's spaces
> - Domestic sphere
> - Women's knowledge, networks
>
> **Limited Access to:**
> - Men's public spaces
> - Some ceremonies restricted
>
> **Result:** Ethnography reveals women's worlds invisible to male researchers.

**Shows:** No single complete perspective—positionality shapes what you can see.

## Reflexive Practice: How To Do It

### Before Fieldwork

**1. Identify Your Positionality:**

Write about:
- Your identities (gender, race, class, etc.)
- Your assumptions about the field site
- Your motivations for this research
- Your theoretical leanings
- Your values and politics

**2. Consider How Position Will Shape Research:**

Anticipate:
- Who will trust you?
- Where will you have access?
- What might you miss?
- What privileges do you bring?
- What vulnerabilities?

**3. Prepare:**

- Learn about power dynamics in this context
- Consider how to mitigate problematic dynamics
- Plan reflexive practices (journaling, etc.)

### During Fieldwork

**1. Keep Reflexive Journal:**

Separate from field notes, record:
- Your emotional reactions
- Uncomfortable moments
- Assumptions challenged
- Power dynamics noticed
- Your changing understanding
- Ethical dilemmas

**2. Notice Your Effects:**

How does your presence change things?
- Do people perform for you?
- What conversations stop when you arrive?
- Who treats you differently?
- What's hidden from you?

**3. Track Relationships:**

Who are your key informants?
- Why these people?
- What voices are you missing?
- Who do you like/dislike? (affects interpretation)

**4. Question Your Interpretations:**

When you think you understand something:
- What assumptions am I making?
- Could this mean something different?
- Whose perspective is this?
- What am I taking for granted?

**5. Seek Feedback:**

- Ask informants if your understanding is accurate
- Discuss interpretations with community members
- Get multiple perspectives

### After Fieldwork (Writing)

**1. Acknowledge Position:**

In publications:
- Explain who you are
- How position shaped access, relationships
- What you could/couldn't see

**Not Lengthy Autobiography:**
Relevant aspects that affected research.

**2. Transparent About Methods:**

- How did you gather data?
- Who did you talk to? (demographics)
- What couldn't you observe?
- What limitations due to position?

**3. Whose Voice?**

When writing:
- Am I speaking for people or with them?
- Am I imposing my interpretations?
- Have I honored their perspectives?
- Whose voices are amplified? Silenced?

**4. Power in Representation:**

Acknowledge:
- You control the narrative
- You benefit (career)
- They bear risks

## Reflexivity in Practice: Examples

### Abu-Lughod: "Writing Against Culture"

**Lila Abu-Lughod (anthropologist of Arab descent studying Bedouin):**

**Reflexivity:**
- Acknowledged partial insider status (Arab heritage)
- But outsider (American, educated, not Bedouin)
- Examined how she was positioned
- How this affected access and interpretation

**Argued:**
Ethnography should "write against culture"—avoid:
- Homogenizing (all Bedouin are X)
- Essentializing (Bedouin culture is inherently Y)
- Othering (they are different from us)

**Instead:**
- Show heterogeneity
- Individual experiences
- Power differences within groups
- Avoid treating "culture" as explanation

### Behar: "The Vulnerable Observer"

**Ruth Behar:**

**Argued:**
Anthropologists should be vulnerable—acknowledging emotions, personal stakes, not pretending invulnerability.

**But:**
Balance—not self-indulgent, but acknowledging humanity.

**In *Translated Woman*:**
- Reflected on relationship with Esperanza (Mexican woman)
- Power differences (education, nationality)
- Mutual affection and tension
- How translation is transformation
- Her own grief when Esperanza's story broke her heart

**Showed:**
Anthropologist as human, in relationship, affected by research.

### Whiteness and Privilege

**Many white anthropologists now reflect on:**
- How whiteness shapes fieldwork
- Colonial echoes
- Privilege in access, funding, publication
- Responsibility to address racism

> **Example:**
>
> White anthropologist studying Black community:
>
> **Must Consider:**
> - Historical racism
> - Extractive white research on Black people
> - Community skepticism justified
> - What does it mean for white person to profit from Black knowledge?
>
> **Reflexive Approach:**
> - Acknowledge racial dynamics
> - Work to benefit community
> - Amplify Black voices
> - Confront own racism
> - Consider if Black researcher better positioned

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Excessive Reflexivity (Navel-Gazing)

**Problem:**
Ethnography becomes about the anthropologist, not the community.

**Example:**
More pages on anthropologist's feelings than on people studied.

**Balance:**
Acknowledge position but keep focus on community.

### 2. Confessional but Unchanged

**Problem:**
"I'm privileged" without actually changing practices.

**Example:**
Acknowledge power but still extract knowledge, benefit alone.

**Solution:**
Reflexivity must lead to action—reciprocity, collaboration, advocacy.

### 3. Reflexivity as Absolution

**Problem:**
"I acknowledged my bias, so now it's okay."

**Not Enough:**
Acknowledgment doesn't erase harm or inequality.

**Must:**
Actively mitigate, share power, benefit community.

### 4. Assuming Insider = Unproblematic

**Problem:**
Insider researchers sometimes assume position eliminates ethical issues.

**But:**
- Insiders still have power as researchers
- May have class privilege within community
- Can still misrepresent or harm

**Solution:**
Reflexivity needed regardless of insider status.

## Reflexivity and Different Identities

### LGBTQ+ Anthropologists

**Advantages:**
- Access to LGBTQ+ communities
- Understanding from inside
- Challenging heteronormative assumptions

**Challenges:**
- Outing self may be unsafe
- Assumed heteronormativity in some fieldsites
- Navigating homophobia

**Reflexivity:**
How does sexuality shape what you see and can ask?

### Anthropologists of Color

**Advantages:**
- Racial minority status may facilitate rapport with communities of color
- Understanding racism from experience
- Challenging white perspectives

**Challenges:**
- Racism in field (both sites and academy)
- Expectations of representation
- Navigating multiple marginalization

**Reflexivity:**
How does race shape access, interpretation, reception?

### Disabled Anthropologists

**Advantages:**
- Access to disability communities
- Challenging ableist assumptions
- Different embodied knowledge

**Challenges:**
- Physical access to fieldsites
- Accommodations
- Stigma

**Reflexivity:**
How does ability/disability shape fieldwork?

### Indigenous Anthropologists

**Advantages:**
- Studying own communities
- Decolonizing from within
- Accountable to community

**Challenges:**
- Dual loyalty (community and discipline)
- Western academy may devalue indigenous knowledge
- Can't "leave" field

**Reflexivity:**
How to serve community while meeting academic expectations?

## Limits of Reflexivity

### What Reflexivity Can't Do

**1. Can't Make You Objective:**
Acknowledging bias doesn't eliminate it.

**2. Can't Erase Power:**
Recognizing privilege doesn't equalize power.

**3. Can't Guarantee Truth:**
Multiple positioned perspectives, no single truth.

**4. Can't Solve All Ethical Problems:**
Awareness doesn't resolve dilemmas.

### Critiques of Reflexivity

**Some Say:**
- Too focused on researcher
- Postmodern self-indulgence
- Distracts from substantive findings
- Assumes individual reflection solves structural problems

**Response:**
Reflexivity valuable BUT insufficient alone—must combine with:
- Structural analysis
- Collaboration
- Reciprocity
- Action

---

## Reflexivity as Ongoing

**Not One-Time:**
- Not just acknowledge position in introduction
- Reflexivity throughout research process
- In writing, representation, dissemination

**Continual Questions:**
- How am I shaping what I see?
- Whose perspectives am I privileging?
- What am I missing?
- How is power operating?
- How can I do less harm?

**Reflexivity is humility:**
Recognizing limits of your knowledge, perspective, understanding.

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** If everyone's perspective is positioned and partial, is anthropological knowledge just subjective opinion?

**Question 2:** Can too much reflexivity paralyze research? Where's the balance?

**Question 3:** Does acknowledging privilege without changing practices make you complicit in inequality?

**Question 4:** Should anthropologists only study communities they're insider to? Or does outsider perspective have value?

**Question 5:** What aspects of your identity would most shape how you'd be received as an anthropologist?

**Remember:** Reflexivity isn't optional—it's fundamental to good anthropology. Pretending to be objective, neutral, or invisible is intellectually dishonest and ethically problematic. Your position shapes your research—what you can access, who you can talk to, what you notice, how you interpret. Acknowledging this doesn't weaken anthropology; it strengthens it by making the knowledge production process transparent. But reflexivity isn't enough—it must be accompanied by action: reciprocity, collaboration, accountability, working to benefit communities. Reflexivity without action is performative. Reflexivity with action is transformative.
