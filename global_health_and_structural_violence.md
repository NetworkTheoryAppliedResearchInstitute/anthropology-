---

## Structural Violence

### Paul Farmer's Framework

**Paul Farmer (Physician-Anthropologist):**
- Harvard, Partners in Health
- Haiti, Rwanda, Peru, globally
- Critical medical anthropology

**"Pathologies of Power" (2003):**

**Structural Violence:**
- Social arrangements harm people
- Poverty, racism, sexism
- Not individual acts
- Systemic, structural
- Makes people sick

**Definition:**
- "Structural violence is violence exerted systematically—that is, indirectly—by everyone who belongs to a certain social order"

**Examples:**
- Poverty preventing healthcare access
- Racism causing health disparities
- Gender inequality increasing HIV risk
- War, colonialism, neoliberalism

**Not Natural:**
- Not "bad luck"
- Not cultural
- Political, economic
- Changeable

### Johan Galtung: Origins

**Galtung (Peace Studies):**
- Coined "structural violence" (1969)
- Direct vs. structural
- Structural kills indirectly

**"Violence is present when human beings are being influenced so that their actual somatic and mental realizations are below their potential realizations"

**Tuberculosis, HIV, Haiti:**
- Emerging infections not new diseases
- Diseases of poverty
- MDR-TB from poverty, not biology alone

**Social Determinants:**
- Housing
- Nutrition
- Clean water
- Healthcare access
- Education

**Reimagining International Health:**
- Health = human right
- Justice, not charity
- Structural change

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is healthcare a human right or privilege?

**Question 2:** Can global health be decolonized within current structures?

**Question 4:** Who is responsible for global health equity?

**Question 5:** How does inequality affect health in your society?

**Remember:** Structural violence (Farmer) is systemic harm through poverty, racism, sexism—makes people sick. Not cultural or natural but political-economic. HIV/AIDS, TB, Ebola, COVID reveal inequality. Partners in Health shows comprehensive care works. Treatment access is justice issue. Syndemics (Singer) show diseases interact with inequality. Maternal mortality, malnutrition, water-borne disease are structural violence. Global health governance critiqued (metrics, NGO-ization, security frame). Decolonizing global health necessary. Understanding global health anthropology reveals health as political, inequality as pathogenic—medicine alone insufficient, justice required. Health anthropology is ultimately about power, rights, and what kind of world we build.
