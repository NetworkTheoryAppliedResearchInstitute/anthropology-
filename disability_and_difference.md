# Disability and Difference: Anthropology of Disability

---

## Medical vs. Social Models of Disability

### Two Paradigms

**Medical Model:**
- Disability = individual impairment
- Bodily/mental deficit
- Needs medical treatment, cure
- Problem in person
- Tragic, unfortunate

**Social Model:**
- Disability = social barriers
- Society disables
- Architecture, attitudes, policies
- Problem in environment
- Oppression, discrimination

**Shift:**
- Disability rights movement
- 1970s-80s
- "Nothing About Us Without Us"
- Social model revolutionary

## Disability Studies

## Cross-Cultural Disability

### Is Disability Universal?

**Question:**
- Does "disability" exist everywhere?
- Or Western category?

**Benedicte Ingstad & Susan Reynolds Whyte:**
- "Disability and Culture" (1995)
- Comparative studies
- Disability culturally constructed

**Findings:**
- All societies recognize bodily/mental difference
- But: categories, meanings vary
- What "counts" as disability differs
- Responses vary

### Examples

> **Bali (Ingstad)**
>
> - Disability = karma (past lives)
> - Families responsible
> - Integrated into community
> - Not institutionalized

> **Botswana (Ingstad)**
>
> - Bolwetsi (people with disability)
> - Varied integration
> - Rural vs. urban
> - Some respected healers
> - But: discrimination exists

> **Nicaragua (Groce)**
>
> - Deaf community
> - Sign language developed
> - Before national education
> - Integrated socially

> **Martha's Vineyard (Groce)**
>
> **"Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language" (1985):**
> - 17th-19th century
> - High hereditary deafness
> - Everyone learned sign
> - Deaf integrated fully
> - Not "disabled"
> - Barrier-free society

**Insight:**
- Disability = relationship between body and environment
- Change environment → change disability

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is disability in the body or in society?

**Question 2:** Should disability be cured, or society changed?

**Question 3:** Is prenatal testing for disability eugenics?

**Question 4:** Can independence be the goal, or should we embrace interdependence?

**Question 5:** How does your society disable or enable difference?

**Remember:** Medical model (disability = individual impairment) vs. social model (society disables). Disability studies is interdisciplinary field critiquing medicalization. Cross-culturally, disability meanings vary (Martha's Vineyard deaf community, Bali karma). Deaf culture challenges disability label—ASL, identity, cochlear implant debates. Neurodiversity paradigm (autism as difference). Intellectual disability stigma, eugenics legacy, deinstitutionalization mixed results. Physical disability and access barriers. Blindness cross-culturally. Disability rights movement won ADA, UN Convention. Crip theory intersects with queer theory. Reproductive justice tensions (abortion rights vs. anti-eugenics). Care and interdependence challenge independence ideal. Understanding disability anthropology reveals how societies create categories of normal/abnormal, enable/disable—and how disability is produced socially, not just biologically. Disability justice is social justice.
