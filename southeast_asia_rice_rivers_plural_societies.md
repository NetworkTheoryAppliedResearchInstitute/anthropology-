# Southeast Asia: Rice, Rivers, and Plural Societies

---

## Southeast Asia: Overview

### Region

**Countries:**
- **Mainland:** Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam
- **Insular (Island):** Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Timor-Leste

**Geography:**
- Tropical (mostly)
- Monsoons (seasonal rains)
- Rivers (major: Irrawaddy, Chao Phraya, Mekong, Red River)
- Mountains, lowlands
- Islands, archipelagos

**Population:**
- ~680 million
- Diverse (ethnically, linguistically, religiously)

---

## Ecological and Cultural Zones

### Lowlands vs. Uplands

**Edmund Leach:**
- *Political Systems of Highland Burma* (1954)
- Kachin (Myanmar/Burma highlands)
- **Oscillation:** Between *gumlao* (egalitarian) and *gumsa* (hierarchical) systems
  - Not static (societies shift)
- Highland/lowland interactions (key)

**James C. Scott:**
- *The Art of Not Being Governed* (2009)
- **"Zomia":** Upland Southeast Asia (highlands across borders)
  - Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, China (borderlands)
- Thesis: Uplanders = refugees from state (fled lowland states, taxes, conscription)
- "State evasion" strategies (mobile, shifting agriculture, oral cultures)
- Controversial (some

 critique as romanticizing)

**General Pattern:**
- **Lowlands:** Wet rice, dense populations, states, Buddhism/Islam
- **Uplands:** Shifting cultivation, lower density, egalitarian, animism

---

## Wet Rice Agriculture

### Foundation

**Paddy Fields:**
- Flooded fields (terraced, irrigated)
- Labor-intensive (transplanting, weeding, harvesting)
- High yields (supports dense populations)

**Social Implications:**
- Cooperation (irrigation requires coordination)
- Sedentary (permanent fields)
- States (surplus supports)

**Clifford Geertz:**
- *Agricultural Involution* (1963)
  - Java (Indonesia)
  - Wet rice = "involution" (intensification, diminishing returns)
  - Absorbs labor (population growth → more labor in same fields)
  - Contrast: "Outer Islands" (Indonesia, extensive agriculture)

---

## Theravada Buddhism

### Mainland Dominance

**Countries:**
- Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Sri Lanka (see South Asia)

**Sangha (Monastic Order):**
- Monks (celibate, renunciants)
- Supported by laity (donations, *dana*)
- Merit-making (laity give, gain merit for better rebirth)

**Rituals:**
- Ordination (temporary, many men, rite of passage)
- Festivals (Vesak, water festivals)
- Meditation (Vipassana, insight)

**Anthropological Work:**

**Melford Spiro:**
- *Buddhism and Society* (1970)
  - Burma (Myanmar)
  - "Apotropaic Buddhism" (protection, worldly benefits)
  - "Kammatic Buddhism" (merit, better rebirth)
  - "Nibbanic Buddhism" (liberation, nirvana)
  - Levels of engagement (not everyone seeks nirvana)

**Stanley Tambiah:**
- *Buddhism and the Spirit Cults in North-East Thailand* (1970)
  - Buddhism + animism (coexist)
  - Spirits (*phi*), spirit mediums
  - Complementary (not contradictory)

---

## Animism and Spirit Beliefs

### Pervasive

**Across Region:**
- Spirits (*phi* Thailand/Laos, *nat* Myanmar, *neak ta* Cambodia, etc.)
- Ancestor spirits
- Nature spirits (trees, rivers, mountains)

**Coexistence:**
- Buddhism/Islam + animism (layered)
- Not "survival" (dynamic, ongoing)

**Practices:**
- Spirit houses (shrines, offerings)
- Possession (mediums, trance)
- Exorcism, healing

---

## Mainland States

### Historical Kingdoms

**Angkor (Cambodia, 802-1431):**

---

## Plural Societies

### Colonial Legacy

**J.S. Furnivall:**

  - Colonial Burma, Indonesia
  - Multiple ethnic/religious groups
  - Economic specialization (ethnic division of labor)
  - Minimal social integration (meet only in marketplace)

**Examples:**
- Colonial Burma: Burmese, Indians, Chinese, Europeans (separate)
- Colonial Malaya: Malays, Chinese, Indians (separate spheres)

**Post-Colonial:**
- Ethnic tensions (inherited)
- Nation-building challenges

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are upland peoples "state evaders" (Scott) or just different adaptations?

**Question 2:** How do Buddhism and animism coexist without contradiction?

**Question 3:** What are the legacies of plural societies in post-colonial nations?

**Question 4:** Can anthropology address genocide and mass violence adequately?

**Question 5:** How does wet rice agriculture shape social organization?
