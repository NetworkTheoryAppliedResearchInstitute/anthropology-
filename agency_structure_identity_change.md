# Cross-Cutting Themes: Agency and Structure, Identity and Belonging, Change and Continuity

---

## THEME 1: Agency and Structure

### The Central Tension

**Structure:**
- Social patterns, institutions, rules (constrain individual action)
- Culture, language, economy, kinship, politics (pre-exist individuals)
- Reproduction (structures persist, shape new generations)

**Agency:**
- Individual/collective capacity to act (make choices, resist, transform)
- Intentionality, creativity, resistance
- NOT determined (people shape structures even as structures shape them)

**Debate:**
- How much are people determined by structures?
- How much can people change structures?
- Anthropology: BOTH (dialectical, mutually constitutive)

---

### Theoretical Frameworks

**Pierre Bourdieu - Practice Theory:**
- **Habitus:** Dispositions (internalized structures, shape action)
  - Class-based, embodied, durable
  - Generate practices (without conscious calculation)
- **Field:** Social arenas (with rules, capital, struggles)
- **Practice:** Where structure meets agency
  - Habitus (structure) generates practices (agency)
  - BUT: Improvisational, strategic, not mechanical
- Example: Parallel cousin marriage (Algeria)
  - Structure: Ideal preference
  - Agency: Strategy (practical logic, actual choices vary)

**Sherry Ortner - Practice Theory:**
- *"Theory in Anthropology Since the Sixties"* (1984)
  - Synthesis (structure + agency)
  - Practice (key concept, 1980s turn)
- Actors (intentional, BUT within structural constraints)
- Structures (enable AND constrain)

**Anthony Giddens - Structuration:**
- Structure AND agency (inseparable, mutually constitutive)
- **Duality of structure:** Structures = medium AND outcome of practices
  - Rules (enable action, but also reproduced through action)
- Example: Language
  - Structure (grammar, vocabulary, pre-exists speaker)
  - Agency (speakers use creatively, innovate, change language)

**Marshall Sahlins - Structure and History:**
- *Islands of History* (1985)
  - Structures (cultural schemas, shape perception, action)
  - Events (agency, can transform structures)
- Example: Captain Cook, Hawaii (1779)
  - Hawaiians (interpreted Cook through existing categories, god Lono)
  - Cook's death (event, transformed Hawaiian structures)

---

### Agency in Kinship

**Arranged Marriage:**
- Structure: Family arranges (parents decide)
- Agency: Individuals negotiate (consent, refusal, influence choice)
- Example: India (arranged but "love-cum-arranged," hybrid)

**Women's Agency:**
- Patriarchy (structural constraint)
- BUT: Women resist, strategize, create spaces
- Example: Lila Abu-Lughod, Bedouin women
  - Poetry (express forbidden sentiments, resistance)
  - Uphold honor codes (BUT subvert through discourse)

---

### Agency in Economic Systems

**Peasant Resistance:**
- James Scott (*Weapons of the Weak*, 1985)
  - Everyday resistance (foot-dragging, sabotage, theft, gossip)
  - NOT open rebellion (too risky)
  - Agency (within structural domination)

**Informal Economies:**
- Structure: Formal economy excludes (unemployment, barriers)
- Agency: Create informal work (street vending, hustling, survival)
- Example: Sudhir Venkatesh, Chicago (*Off the Books*)

**Labor Organizing:**
- Structure: Capitalism exploits workers
- Agency: Unions, strikes, collective action
- Successes (better wages, conditions) AND failures (repression, cooptation)

---

### Agency in Political Systems

**Hegemony and Resistance:**
- Gramsci: Hegemony (ruling class, consent through ideology)
- BUT: Counter-hegemony (alternatives, resistance possible)
- Agency: People can challenge, create alternative visions

**Social Movements:**
- Structure: State power, repression, inequality
- Agency: Mobilize, protest, demand change
- Examples: Civil rights, indigenous rights, women's movements, environmental justice
- Outcomes: Vary (some succeed, some fail, some partial victories)

**"Weapons of the Weak":**
- Hidden transcripts (Scott)
  - Public: Deference, compliance
  - Private: Mockery, defiance, resistance
- Agency: Covert, strategic, within structural constraints

---

### Agency and Gender

**Saba Mahmood - *Politics of Piety* (2005):**
- Egyptian women's mosque movement (piety)
- Western feminism: Resistance = liberation from patriarchy
- Mahmood: Piety = agency (cultivating virtuous self)
  - NOT false consciousness (genuine aspiration)
- Agency: NOT always about resistance (also about inhabiting norms)

**Gendered Structures:**
- Patriarchy, division of labor, marriage rules (constrain)
- Women's strategies: Navigate, negotiate, sometimes resist, sometimes accommodate

---

### Agency in Religion

**Conversion:**
- Structure: Religion transmitted (family, community, socialization)
- Agency: Individuals convert (choose, commit)
- Motivations: Belief, community, material benefits, marriage

**Syncretism:**
- Structure: Dominant religion imposed (colonialism, state)
- Agency: People blend (incorporate local practices, beliefs)
- Example: Latin American Catholicism + indigenous (syncretism)

---

### Agency in Language

**Speakers:**
- Structure: Grammar, vocabulary (constrain what can be said)
- Agency: Creativity (new words, meanings, code-switching, poetry)
- Language change (driven by speakers, agency)

**Code-Switching:**
- Bilingual speakers (switch languages strategically)
- Agency: Choose language (context, audience, identity claims)

---

### Agency and Constraint in Archaeology

**Material Culture:**
- Structure: Technology, resources, environment (constrain)
- Agency: Innovation, adaptation, choice (within constraints)

**Monuments:**
- Structure: Elites command labor (coercion)
- Agency: Workers (resist, negotiate, sometimes willingly participate)

---

### Provocations

**Question 1:** Are we free or determined?

**Question 2:** Can agency exist without structure?

**Question 3:** Is resistance always progressive?

**Question 4:** How do you experience structure and agency in your life?

---

## THEME 2: Identity and Belonging

### Constructing Identity

**NOT:**
- Fixed, essential, natural
- Single (people have multiple identities)

**BUT:**
- Constructed, performed, negotiated
- Situational (shift depending on context)
- Relational (defined in relation to others, boundaries)

**Anthropology:**
- Denaturalizes identity (shows it's made, not given)
- Contextualizes (how identity works in specific settings)

---

### Ethnic Identity

**Constructivist View:**
- Fredrik Barth (*Ethnic Groups and Boundaries*, 1969)
  - Ethnicity = boundaries (NOT shared culture)
  - Boundaries (maintained through interaction, marking difference)
  - Content (can change, but boundary persists)

**Primordialism:**
- Ethnicity (deep, ancient, kinship-like attachments)
- Critique: Essentializes, ignores history, construction

**Instrumentalism:**
- Ethnicity (strategic, mobilized for resources, power)
- Elite manipulation (leaders invoke ethnicity for political ends)
- Critique: Reduces to strategy, ignores genuine sentiments

**Synthesis:**
- Ethnicity (both felt AND constructed, both primordial AND instrumental)

---

### National Identity

**Benedict Anderson - *Imagined Communities* (1983):**
- Nation = imagined (members never meet, yet feel connection)
- Print capitalism (newspapers, novels, shared time)
- Mechanisms: Language, media, education, symbols (flag, anthem)

**Nationalism:**
- Modern (Ernest Gellner, industrial society requires homogenization)
- Invented traditions (Hobsbawm, Scottish kilts, recent)

**Belonging:**
- Citizenship (legal membership)
- Cultural belonging (feeling part of nation)
- Exclusions (minorities, migrants, may not "belong")

---

### Racial Identity

**Race:**
- Socially constructed (no biological basis)
- BUT: Real consequences (racism, inequality, violence)

**Racialization:**
- Process (bodies marked, categorized, differential treatment)
- Historical (slavery, colonialism, segregation)
- Ongoing (police profiling, hiring discrimination)

**Identity:**
- Imposed (external categorization, by dominant)
- Claimed (self-identification, solidarity, political)
- Example: Black identity (U.S., forged through oppression, resistance, culture)

---

### Gender Identity

**Cultural Variation:**
- Two sexes, two genders (NOT universal)
- Third genders (hijra India, two-spirit Native American, fa'afafine Samoa)
- Gender roles (vary enormously, culturally specific)

**Performance:**
- Judith Butler (gender = performance, not essence)
- Repeated acts (create appearance of stable gender)
- Anthropology: Gender categories (culturally constructed, vary)

---

### Religious Identity

**Conversion:**
- Change identity (become Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, etc.)
- Significant (reshapes life, community, practice)

**Diaspora:**
- Maintain religious identity (temples, mosques, churches abroad)
- Adaptation (practices change, but identity persists)
- Example: Hindu temples U.S. (different context, similar functions)

---

### Belonging

**Place:**
- Attachment to place (homeland, village, neighborhood)
- Displacement (migration, refugees, loss of place, identity disrupted)

**Community:**
- Belonging through membership (kinship, village, ethnic, religious, national)
- Exclusion (who doesn't belong, boundaries)

**Citizenship:**
- Legal belonging (rights, protections)
- Partial (undocumented, refugees, stateless, lack full belonging)

---

### Diaspora and Transnational Identity

**Diaspora:**
- Scattered populations (maintain ties to homeland, shared identity)
- Examples: Jewish, Armenian, African, Chinese, Indian diasporas
- Hybridity (identity neither homeland nor host, both/and)

**Transnational:**
- Lives span borders (maintain multiple identities, belongings)
- NOT either/or (Filipino-American, maintain both)

---

### Provocations

**Question 1:** Can you choose your identity?

**Question 2:** Is there a "true self" or are all identities constructed?

**Question 3:** What makes you feel you belong (or don't belong)?

**Question 4:** Can identity be multiple and contradictory?

---

## THEME 3: Change and Continuity

### The Paradox

**Change:**
- Societies, cultures, technologies (always changing)
- Nothing static, no "traditional" frozen societies

**Continuity:**
- Patterns persist (language, kinship, rituals, passed down)
- Structures reproduce (inequality, power, cultural schemas)

**Anthropology:**
- Both/and (change AND continuity, simultaneously)
- Change often reproduces structures (paradoxically)

---

### Cultural Change

**Sources:**
- Internal: Innovation, creativity, generational shifts
- External: Contact, trade, conquest, migration, media

**Diffusion:**
- Ideas, technologies spread (between societies)
- Example: Agriculture (Neolithic, spread from multiple centers)

**Acculturation:**
- Contact between cultures (change, both sides BUT unequal power)
- Example: Colonialism (forced acculturation, indigenous to European)

**Syncretism:**
- Blending (religious, cultural practices merge)
- Example: Latin American Catholicism (indigenous + Spanish)

---

### Continuity Through Change

**Invention of Tradition:**
- Hobsbawm & Ranger: Traditions often recent (invented, claim antiquity)
- Example: Scottish Highland dress (tartans, kilts, 18th-19th centuries)
- Change (creating new practices) presented as continuity (ancient traditions)

**Strategic Essentialism:**
- Gayatri Spivak: Temporarily claim fixed identity (political strategy)
- Indigenous peoples (claim "traditional" for land rights, even as culture changes)
- Change (actual lives) but continuity (claimed for political purposes)

---

### Globalization: Change or Continuity?

**Homogenization Thesis:**
- Globalization = sameness (McDonald's everywhere, Americanization)

**Heterogenization:**
- Local appropriations (global transforms locally, NOT uniform)
- Example: McDonald's India (vegetarian, no beef, culturally adapted)

**Continuity:**
- Despite globalization, differences persist (language, religion, kinship)
- Identities (often strengthened, reactive to globalization)

---

### Historical Change

**Sahlins - Structure and History:**
- Events (can transform structures)
- BUT: Interpreted through existing structures (so continuity in change)
- Example: Captain Cook, Hawaii
  - Event (Cook arrives, killed)
  - Transformation (Hawaiian structures changed)
  - BUT: Interpreted through existing categories (Lono, Hawaiian cosmology)

---

### Revolutionary Change

**Revolutions:**
- Political (French, Russian, Chinese, Cuban, etc.)
- Claim radical break (create "new man," new society)
- Reality: Continuities (power structures, inequalities often persist)

**Post-Socialist:**
- Fall of communism (1989-1991, massive change)
- Continuity: Elites (often same people, networks, renamed)
- Nostalgia (Ostalgie, longing for stability, selective memory)

---

### Technological Change

**Digital Revolution:**
- Internet, smartphones (rapid, global, transformative)
- Change: Communication, work, relationships, knowledge

**Continuity:**
- Power structures (tech giants monopolistic, inequality reproduces)
- Social needs (connection, identity, same but mediated differently)

---

### Climate Change

**Unprecedented:**
- Anthropocene (planetary transformation, human-caused)
- Sixth mass extinction, warming, sea level rise

**Continuity:**
- Capitalism (continues despite crisis, "business as usual")
- Inequality (same structures, Global North causes, South suffers)

**Adaptation:**
- Change (forced by climate)
- Continuity (drawing on existing knowledge, TEK)

---

### Provocations

**Question 1:** Is change accelerating or have humans always experienced rapid change?

**Question 2:** Can there be revolution without continuity?

**Question 3:** What is the relationship between change and power?

**Question 4:** Do you experience your life as stable or changing?

---

## Connections Across Themes

**Power + Agency:** Who has power shapes who has agency (but agency can challenge power)

**Identity + Structure:** Identities constructed within structures (but also transformed by agency)

**Globalization + Change:** Globalization = driver of change (but also continuities, resistances)

**Inequality + Identity:** Identities (racialized, gendered, classed) reproduce inequality

**ALL THEMES:** Interconnected, mutually constitutive, pervade all anthropology

---

**Remember:** Agency structure identity belonging change continuity—three fundamental tensions pervade anthropology revealing human condition navigation constraints creativity.
