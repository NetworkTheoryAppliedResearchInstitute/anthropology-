## Arnold Van Gennep: "Rites of Passage" (1909)

### The Three-Phase Structure

**Van Gennep's Discovery:**
- Life-crisis rituals worldwide share structure
- Three phases: separation, transition, incorporation

**Rites of Passage:**
- Mark transitions in social status
- Birth, puberty, marriage, death
- But also: seasons, office-taking, war/peace

**The Three Phases:**

**1. Separation (Preliminal):**
- Detachment from previous status
- Symbolic death
- Leave old identity
- Often physical separation

**2. Transition/Margin (Liminal):**
- Between states
- Ambiguous, betwixt-and-between
- Dangerous, powerful
- "Neither here nor there"
- Often seclusion

**3. Incorporation (Postliminal):**
- Integration into new status
- Rebirth
- New rights, duties
- Return to society

**Structure = Universal:**
- Not specific content
- Framework adaptable

### Examples

> **Puberty Initiations**
>
> **Boys' Initiation (Many Societies):**
>
> **Separation:**
> - Removed from mothers, women
> - Taken to forest, bush, isolated area
> - Childhood identity stripped
>
> **Transition:**
> - Ordeals (circumcision, scarification, fasting)
> - Teachings (myths, secrets, skills)
> - Liminality (neither boy nor man)
> - Weeks, months, even years
>
> **Incorporation:**
> - Return to village
> - Celebrated as men
> - New name, status, responsibilities
> - Marriage-eligible

> **Marriage Rituals**
>
> **Separation:**
> - Bride/groom leave natal families
> - Special dress
> - Leave childhood homes
>
> **Transition:**
> - Wedding ceremony
> - Liminal state (becoming married)
> - Rituals, vows
>
> **Incorporation:**
> - Introduced as married couple
> - New household
> - New social relations

> **Funerals**
>
> **Separation:**
> - Death separates from living
> - Body prepared, separated
>
> **Transition:**
> - Liminal period (corpse dangerous)
> - Mourning period
> - Soul travels
>
> **Incorporation:**
> - Burial, cremation
> - Soul joins ancestors
> - Mourners reintegrated

**Insight:**
- Rituals structure social change
- Make transitions safe, meaningful
- Community witnesses, validates

## Victor Turner: Liminality and Communitas

### Elaborating Van Gennep

**Turner (1960s-70s):**
- Focuses on **liminal phase**
- Most interesting, transformative
- Fieldwork: Ndembu (Zambia)

### Liminality

**"Betwixt and Between":**
- Liminal beings have no status
- Socially invisible
- Ambiguous, dangerous
- Ground down to uniform condition

**Characteristics:**

**Neophytes (Initiates):**
- Passive, humble
- Obedient to ritual elders
- No rank, property
- Uniform (naked, or identical dress)
- Often secluded

**Why?**
- Must die to old status
- Be reborn to new
- Blank slate for transformation

**Symbolism:**
- Death and rebirth
- Wilderness (outside society)
- Darkness, nakedness
- Pollution, danger

**Liminal Is Powerful:**
- Creative, transformative
- Generate new ideas
- Source of renewal

**Not Just Initiations:**
- Pilgrimage (liminality)
- Monasticism
- Countercultural movements

### Communitas

**Turner's Key Concept:**

**Communitas = Anti-Structure:**
- During liminality, experience unstructured community
- No hierarchy, rank
- Direct, immediate relationships
- Equality, solidarity
- "Existential communitas"

**Contrast:**

**Structure:**
- Normal society
- Hierarchy, roles, status
- Segmented

**Communitas:**
- Liminal phase
- Undifferentiated
- Intense bonding
- Egalitarian

**Examples:**

> **Pilgrimage (Turner & Turner)**
>
> - Pilgrims leave home
> - Liminal journey
> - Strangers bond
> - Communitas on road
> - Return transformed

> **Hippies, Counterculture**
>
> - Turner analyzed 1960s movements
> - Anti-structure
- Communitas as ideal
> - Liminoid (voluntary, not obligatory)

**Function:**
- Renews society
- Provides alternative to structure
- Balance

**Dialectic:**
- Structure ↔ Communitas
- Both necessary
- Communitas can't persist (becomes structure)
- But regenerates structure

### Ritual Symbols

**Ndembu Rituals:**

**Mudyi Tree:**
- White sap = milk
- Multivocal symbol

**Three Levels of Meaning:**

**1. Exegetical:**
- What Ndembu say (matriliny, motherhood)

**2. Operational:**
- What happens in ritual (actions around tree)

**3. Positional:**
- Relation to other symbols

**Dominant Symbols:**
- Condensation (many meanings)
- Unification (disparate meanings)
- Polarization (physiological ↔ social/moral)

**Ritual Process:**
- Manipulates symbols
- Evokes emotions
- Transforms participants

### Critique of Turner

**Romanticizes Communitas:**
- Not always egalitarian
- Initiations can be violent, oppressive
- Gendered (often male privilege)

**Functionalist:**
- Assumes rituals integrate
- Ignores conflict, resistance

**But Influential:**
- Liminality widely adopted
- Applied to modernity (artists, travelers, marginal groups)

## Roy Rappaport: "Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity" (1999)

### Ritual as Communication

**Rappaport's Argument:**
- Ritual is **performative utterance**
- Creates social reality
- Not just expresses belief—enacts

**Key Insight:**
- "I do" in wedding = performative
- Says and does simultaneously
- Ritual similarly performative

### Adaptive Function (Earlier Work)

**Tsembaga Maring (New Guinea):**

**Pig Festivals:**
- Ritual cycle regulates ecology
- Pigs accumulate, eat sweet potatoes
- When too many, kaiko (pig feast)
- Slaughter pigs, distribute
- Regulates pig population
- Ecological adaptation

**Cybernetic System:**
- Ritual as regulatory mechanism
- Homeostasis

**Critique:**
- Too functionalist
- Assumes harmony
- But influential: ritual has material effects

### Sanctity and Ultimate Sacred Postulates

**Later Work (Philosophical):**

**Ritual Creates:**
- **Sanctity** (unquestionable, invariant)
- **Ultimate Sacred Postulates** (cosmological axioms)

**How?**
- Formality of ritual
- Repetition
- Collective participation
- Creates "obvious" truths

**Example:**
- "God exists" (ultimate sacred postulate)
- Ritual doesn't argue—enacts as if true
- Participation = acceptance

**Function:**
- Provides foundation
- Unquestionable ground
- Enables social order

**Without Ritual:**
- All contestable
- No shared foundations
- Social coordination difficult

**Critique:**
- Assumes consensus
- Ignores resistance
- But insight: ritual creates certainty

## Catherine Bell: "Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice" (1992)

### Practice Theory Approach

**Bell's Critique:**

**Problem with Previous Theories:**
- Separate thought from action
- "Ritual expresses belief"
- Dualism (mind/body, thought/action)

**Bell's Alternative:**
- **Ritualization** (not "ritual")
- Practice creates meaning
- No prior "belief" ritual expresses
- Ritual action itself is meaning-making

### Ritualization

**Not "What Is Ritual?"**
- But "How Do People Ritualize?"
- Emphasis on process, strategy

**Ritualization:**
- Particular way of acting
- Sets some acts apart as "special"
- Strategic distinction (ritual vs. ordinary)
- Power-laden

**Features:**
- Formalism
- Traditionalism
- Invariance
- Rule-governed
- Sacral symbolism
- Performance

**But:**
- Fuzzy boundaries
- Degrees of ritualization
- Contextual

### Ritual and Power

**Key Insight:**
- Ritual is about power
- Creates hierarchy, authority
- Not neutral
- Produces "ritual actors" and "ritual authorities"

**Ritualization Strategies:**
- Distinguish ritualized from non-ritualized
- Create privileged actors
- Naturalize hierarchy
- Mask domination as sacred

**Example:**
- Catholic Mass
- Priest authorized
- Laity passive
- Hierarchy ritualized, naturalized

**Gendered:**
- Often male privilege
- Women excluded from ritual authority
- Ritual reproduces patriarchy

**But Resistance Possible:**
- People can subvert
- Reinterpret
- Appropriate

### Critique of Functionalism

**Rituals Don't "Do" Things Simply:**
- Not tools with functions
- Complex, contested
- Multiple effects
- Power struggles

**Against Durkheim, Turner:**
- Ritual doesn't simply integrate
- Can divide, oppress, resist

**Practice Approach:**
- People use ritual strategically
- Meaning emerges from practice
- Not pre-given

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Do modern secular societies have rituals? (Graduations, weddings, sports?)

**Question 2:** Can ritual create belief, or only express pre-existing belief?

**Question 3:** Is communitas always temporary, or can it become permanent?

**Question 4:** Are rituals inherently conservative (maintain tradition) or transformative?

**Question 5:** What happens when people no longer believe in rituals they perform?

**Remember:** Rituals structure social transitions through separation, liminality, and incorporation (Van Gennep). Liminality is transformative, generating communitas and anti-structure (Turner). Rituals communicate, perform reality, and create sanctity (Rappaport). Ritualization is practice involving power, not just belief expression (Bell). No single theory explains all rituals—each offers insights. Understanding ritual theory reveals how humans mark transitions, create meaning, establish authority, and navigate change. Rituals aren't just "tradition"—they're active, strategic, powerful practices that make and remake social worlds.
