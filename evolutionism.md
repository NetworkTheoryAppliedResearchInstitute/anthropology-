# Evolutionism: Anthropology's Problematic Beginning (1860s-1900s)

---

## The Victorian Dream of Progress

Imagine sitting in a London gentleman's club in 1870. Britain rules a quarter of the globe. Steamships and telegraphs are shrinking the world. Darwin's *Origin of Species* (1859) has just revolutionized biology. The future seems limitless.

A group of scholars gathers to discuss the "primitive peoples" encountered through colonial expansion. They ask: Why are some societies so "advanced" while others remain "savage"? Why do Europeans have factories and empires while others live in grass huts?

Their answer, which would define early anthropology: **All societies evolve through the same stages, from savagery to civilization. Europeans have simply evolved further.**

This was **unilineal cultural evolution**—anthropology's founding paradigm and its original sin. It provided scientific justification for colonialism, racism, and cultural destruction. And yet, from these deeply flawed beginnings, modern anthropology would eventually emerge.

## Core Ideas of Evolutionary Anthropology

### The Evolutionary Ladder

Victorian evolutionists envisioned human societies arranged on a ladder:

**SAVAGERY → BARBARISM → CIVILIZATION**

Each stage had characteristic features:

**Savagery:**
- Hunting and gathering
- No agriculture
- Simple tools
- No writing
- Promiscuous sexuality
- No government
- **Examples:** Australian Aborigines, Tierra del Fuegans, "Bushmen"

**Barbarism:**
- Agriculture or pastoralism
- Pottery
- Improved tools
- Still no writing
- Developing social organization
- **Examples:** Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Sub-Saharan Africans

**Civilization:**
- Writing
- Cities
- Complex government
- Advanced technology
- Monotheistic religion
- **Examples:** Ancient civilizations, modern Europeans

### Key Assumptions

**1. Psychic Unity of Mankind**
- All humans have the same mental capacities
- Cultural differences aren't due to biology
- (This was actually progressive for its time!)

**2. Unilineal Evolution**
- All societies pass through the same stages in the same order
- Evolution is directional and inevitable
- "Lower" societies are living fossils showing Europe's past

**3. Comparative Method**
- Study "primitive" societies to understand human origins
- Modern "savages" represent earlier evolutionary stages
- Reconstruct history through comparison

**4. Progress is Universal**
- Evolution is improvement
- Civilization represents human perfection
- Non-European societies will/should evolve toward European model

## The Major Evolutionist Thinkers

### Edward Burnett Tylor (1832-1917): The Founding Father

**Background:**
- British Quaker, couldn't attend Oxford/Cambridge (reserved for Anglicans)
- Traveled to Mexico, became fascinated with ancient civilizations
- First professor of anthropology at Oxford (1896)

**Major Work:** *Primitive Culture* (1871)

**Key Contributions:**

**1. Definition of Culture:**
> "Culture, or civilization, taken in its wide ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."

This became anthropology's foundational concept—culture as learned, not innate.

**2. Theory of Animism:**
Tylor argued religion evolved through stages:
- **Animism:** Belief that all things have spirits (earliest religion)
- **Polytheism:** Multiple gods
- **Monotheism:** One god (highest form)

He claimed "primitive" peoples believed in animism because they couldn't distinguish dreams from reality, leading them to believe in souls and spirits.

**3. Survivals:**
Tylor noticed seemingly irrational customs in European society (knocking on wood, saying "bless you" after sneezing). He called these **survivals**—remnants of earlier evolutionary stages that persist even though their original meaning is lost.

> **Example:** Wedding traditions
>
> Tylor analyzed wedding customs (throwing rice, carrying bride over threshold, bouquet toss) as survivals of earlier practices:
> - Throwing rice = ancient fertility magic
> - Carrying bride = survival of marriage by capture
> - Bouquet = transferring fertility to next bride
>
> These seemed irrational in Victorian England but made sense as survivals from "savage" stages.

**The Problem with Tylor:**
While Tylor believed all humans had equal mental capacity, he still ranked cultures hierarchically with Europeans on top. His explanations for "primitive" religion were condescending—assuming "savages" were confused or childlike in their thinking.

### Lewis Henry Morgan (1818-1898): The American Evolutionist

**Background:**
- American lawyer and businessman
- Lived in upstate New York, near Iroquois reservations
- Actually did fieldwork with Iroquois people (unusual for his time)
- Adopted into Seneca tribe, given name Tayadaowuhkuh

**Major Work:** *Ancient Society* (1877)

**Key Contributions:**

**1. Stages of Evolution:**
Morgan elaborated the evolutionary scheme with detailed substages:

- **Savagery:** Lower, Middle, Upper (based on technology: fire, bow & arrow, pottery)
- **Barbarism:** Lower, Middle, Upper (based on agriculture, ironworking)
- **Civilization:** Writing onward

**2. Technology as Driver:**
Morgan argued technological development drove social evolution:
- Stone tools → Bow & arrow → Pottery → Agriculture → Metals → Writing
- Each technological advance enabled new forms of social organization

**3. Family Evolution:**
Morgan proposed families evolved through stages:
- Promiscuity (no family)
- Consanguine family (group marriage)
- Punaluan family (siblings couldn't marry but others could)
- Patriarchal family
- Monogamous family (highest form)

**4. Kinship Systems:**
Morgan did groundbreaking comparative work on kinship terminology worldwide, creating elaborate classificatory systems. This work, stripped of its evolutionary framework, remains valuable.

**The Problem with Morgan:**
His family evolution theory was completely wrong—no evidence for these stages exists. He imagined "primitive promiscuity" based on prejudice, not data. However, his detailed ethnographic work with the Iroquois was respectful and valuable.

**Morgan's Influence:**
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels loved Morgan's work, seeing it as evidence that private property and the state were recent inventions, not human nature. Engels wrote *The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State* (1884) based on Morgan's theories.

### James George Frazer (1854-1941): The Armchair Scholar

**Background:**
- Scottish classicist at Cambridge
- **Never** did fieldwork
- **Never** visited the peoples he wrote about
- Compiled information from missionaries, travelers, colonial administrators

**Major Work:** *The Golden Bough* (1890, expanded to 12 volumes by 1915)

**Key Contributions:**

**1. Evolution of Thought:**
Frazer argued human thought evolved through stages:
- **Magic:** Belief that similar things affect each other (e.g., voodoo dolls)
- **Religion:** Appealing to supernatural beings
- **Science:** Understanding natural laws (highest form)

**2. Comparative Method:**
*The Golden Bough* compared rituals, myths, and beliefs from around the world, finding patterns:
- Dying and rising gods (Osiris, Adonis, Jesus)
- Sacred kings who must die to renew fertility
- Taboos surrounding chiefs and sacred objects
- Sacrifice rituals

**3. Intellectual History:**
Frazer wrote elegant, literary prose that influenced modernist writers (T.S. Eliot's *The Waste Land* draws heavily on Frazer).

**The Problem with Frazer:**
- No fieldwork meant his information was decontextualized and often wrong
- He treated all myths and rituals as essentially the same, ignoring cultural specificity
- His evolutionary scheme (magic → religion → science) was simplistic
- He dismissed non-Western thought as inferior, pre-logical
- His work fed into racist stereotypes of "primitive mentality"

> **Famous Exchange:**
>
> **Question to Frazer:** "Have you ever met any of the savages you write about?"
>
> **Frazer's reply:** "God forbid!"
>
> This epitomizes armchair anthropology's arrogance and distance.

## The Comparative Method: How Evolutionists Worked

### The Approach:

Since evolutionists believed all societies passed through the same stages, they could:

1. **Study modern "primitives"** to understand ancient "primitives"
2. **Compare practices worldwide** to identify evolutionary sequences
3. **Reconstruct human history** without archaeology (which was just developing)

### Example: Evolution of Marriage

**The Evolutionary Sequence (according to evolutionists):**

1. **Promiscuity:** Early humans mated randomly with no family structure
2. **Group Marriage:** Multiple men married multiple women
3. **Polygyny:** One man, multiple wives (still "primitive")
4. **Monogamy:** One man, one woman (civilized)

**The "Evidence":**
- Some societies had group marriage terminology in language (they claimed)
- Some practiced polygyny
- Europeans practiced monogamy
- Therefore, this must be the evolutionary sequence

**The Problems:**
- No evidence of actual promiscuity or group marriage
- Assumed European practices were "highest"
- Ignored cultural specificity and diversity
- Confused linguistic categories with actual practices
- Based on limited, filtered information from non-anthropologists

## What Evolutionists Got Right

### 1. Culture is Learned, Not Biological

**Psychic unity** meant all humans had the same mental capacities. Cultural differences reflected history and environment, not innate ability. This was a crucial anti-racist principle, even though evolutionists still ranked cultures hierarchically.

### 2. The Idea of Culture

Tylor's definition established culture as anthropology's central concept—learned, shared, symbolic patterns of behavior.

### 3. Comparative Perspective

The ambition to understand all humanity comparatively, not just study one's own society, became anthropology's hallmark.

### 4. Some Specific Insights

- Tylor's concept of survivals (though overused) captured real phenomena
- Morgan's kinship work (stripped of evolutionary theory) was groundbreaking
- Frazer identified real cross-cultural patterns in myth and ritual

---

## What Evolutionists Got Catastrophically Wrong

### 1. Ranking Human Societies

The evolutionary ladder placed Europeans at the top and everyone else below. This:
- Justified colonialism ("civilizing" lower societies)
- Supported racism (non-Europeans were "less evolved")
- Enabled cultural destruction ("primitive" practices should be eliminated)
- Harmed millions of people

### 2. Unilineal Evolution

Not all societies pass through the same stages. There's no single path of development. Societies change in diverse ways responding to specific circumstances.

### 3. "Primitive Mentality"

Evolutionists assumed "savages" thought differently—more childlike, less rational, incapable of abstract thought. This was empirically false and deeply racist.

### 4. Armchair Methods

Compiling reports from missionaries and travelers without understanding context produced bad data and worse interpretations.

### 5. Confusing Correlation with Evolution

Just because practice A is "simpler" than practice B doesn't mean A evolved into B. Diversity doesn't equal evolutionary sequence.

## The Social and Political Context

### Why Evolutionism?

**1. Darwinian Revolution:**
Darwin's biological evolution (1859) suggested similar patterns in culture. But cultural evolution doesn't work like biological evolution.

**2. Colonial Expansion:**
Europeans encountered radically different societies and needed to explain the differences. Evolutionism provided a scientific-sounding justification for European dominance.

**3. Victorian Progress:**
The 19th century saw rapid technological and social change. Progress seemed inevitable and universal.

**4. Racism:**
Scientific racism was mainstream. Evolutionism provided an alternative to biological racism (culture, not biology) while still maintaining European superiority.

### The Damage Done

**Evolutionism was used to justify:**
- Taking indigenous lands ("they're not using it productively")
- Forced assimilation ("civilizing" missions)
- Banning indigenous religions ("primitive superstition")
- Removing children to boarding schools ("raising them to civilization")
- Denying political rights ("not evolved enough for self-governance")
- Colonial extraction ("developing" primitive economies)

> **Example: Indian Residential Schools**
>
> In the U.S. and Canada, indigenous children were forcibly removed to boarding schools based on evolutionist thinking:
> - "Kill the Indian, save the man"
> - Force them to abandon "savage" languages and cultures
> - Teach "civilized" ways
> - Assimilate them into European society
>
> Result: Cultural genocide, trauma lasting generations. Schools operated into the 1990s.

## The Decline of Evolutionism

### Why It Fell Apart:

**1. Franz Boas's Critique (1890s-1920s):**
- Demanded actual fieldwork, not armchair speculation
- Showed societies don't follow universal stages
- Emphasized historical particularism over universal laws
- Attacked racist assumptions

**2. Better Ethnographic Data:**
When anthropologists actually lived with "primitive" peoples, they found:
- Sophisticated knowledge systems
- Complex social organizations  
- Logical and rational thought
- No evidence for evolutionary stages

**3. Colonial Critique:**
As colonialism was challenged, evolutionism's role in justifying it became apparent.

**4. Empirical Failures:**
Evolutionist predictions didn't pan out. Societies didn't evolve predictably. Historical evidence contradicted evolutionary schemes.

### The Transition:

By 1920, evolutionism was largely abandoned in favor of:
- **Functionalism** (focus on how societies work, not how they evolved)
- **Historical Particularism** (each culture has unique history)
- **Diffusionism** (cultural traits spread, not evolve independently)

---

## Legacy and Lessons

### Why Study Evolutionism?

**1. Historical Understanding:**
You can't understand modern anthropology without knowing its problematic origins.

**2. Recognizing Bias:**
Evolutionism shows how "science" can be shaped by cultural prejudices and political interests.

**3. Ongoing Issues:**
Evolutionary thinking still appears in:
- Modernization theory
- Development discourse ("developing" vs. "developed" nations)
- "Primitive" vs. "modern" dichotomies
- Assumptions about progress

**4. Valuable Elements:**
Some evolutionist insights, stripped of ranking and racism, remain useful:
- Cultures change over time
- Technology affects social organization
- Cross-cultural comparison reveals patterns

### Contemporary Relevance

**Watch for Neo-Evolutionism:**
- Ranking cultures as "backward" vs. "progressive"
- Assuming Western practices are more "advanced"
- Development as "catching up" to the West
- "Civilizing" rhetoric in foreign policy

**The Lesson:**
Science isn't value-neutral. Theories reflect the societies that produce them. Critical reflexivity is essential.

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Why did educated, intelligent people believe in cultural evolution despite lack of evidence? What made it compelling?

**Question 2:** Can you think of contemporary examples where societies or practices are ranked as "more advanced" or "backward"?

**Question 3:** How might evolutionist ideas persist today in subtle forms, even though explicit evolutionism is rejected?

**Question 4:** Was anything valuable in evolutionism, or was it entirely harmful?

**Question 5:** How can we prevent current anthropology from making similar mistakes—creating "scientific" theories that serve power and prejudice?

**Remember:** Evolutionism represents anthropology at its worst—racist, colonialist, armchair speculation masquerading as science. But it's essential to understand this history. Modern anthropology emerged by rejecting evolutionism's ranking of cultures while preserving its comparative ambition. The discipline's ongoing work to decolonize itself traces back to this problematic beginning.
