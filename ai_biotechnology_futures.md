## Artificial Intelligence and Automation

### Anthropology of AI

**Key Questions:**
- How do people understand, interact with AI?
- What social/cultural assumptions embedded in AI?
- Who builds AI, whose interests served?
- How does AI reshape work, relationships, knowledge?

**NOT:**
- Predicting AI's future (speculative)
- Technical AI development (computer science)
- BUT: Social, cultural, political dimensions of AI

## M.C. Elish and danah boyd

### "Situating methods in the magic of Big Data and AI"** (2018):

**Arguments:**
- AI/machine learning (marketed as magical, objective)
- Reality: Human labor (data labeling, cleaning, interpretation)
- "Humans in the loop" (AI requires constant human intervention)
- Bias (datasets reflect human prejudices)

**Examples:**
- Image recognition (requires millions of labeled images, human annotators)
- Content moderation (AI flags, humans review)
- Self-driving cars (remote human operators intervene)

---

## Mary L. Gray and Siddharth Suri

### Ghost Work

**Ghost Work** (2019):
- Amazon Mechanical Turk, other platforms
- "Ghost work" (invisible labor behind AI)

**Findings:**
- Workers (label data, train algorithms, evaluate outputs)
- Global (India, U.S., Philippines, others)
- Precarious (low pay, no benefits, no job security)
- Misclassification (independent contractors, not employees)

**Examples:**
- Image labeling ("Is this a cat?")
- Transcription (audio to text)
- Content moderation (flag inappropriate)
- Data cleaning

**Argument:**
- AI NOT autonomous (depends on human labor)
- Exploitation (workers invisible, poorly compensated)
- "On-demand" economy (gig work, precarity)

---

## Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler

### "Anatomy of an AI System"** (2018):

**Mapping:**
- Amazon Echo (Alexa)
- Full supply chain (materials, labor, data, power)

**Shows:**
- Extraction (lithium, cobalt, rare earths, mining, environmental/human costs)
- Labor (factory workers, Foxconn, suicides)
- Data (user voice recordings, stored indefinitely, analyzed)
- Energy (data centers, massive electricity, carbon)

**Argument:**
- AI NOT immaterial (deeply material)
- Exploitation (Global South labor, resources)
- Surveillance (constant data extraction)
- Environmental (e-waste, energy consumption)

---

## Nick Seaver

### Music Recommendation

**Computing Taste** (manuscript):
- Music recommendation algorithms (Spotify, Pandora)
- Ethnography (engineers, designers)

**Findings:**
- Engineers (assumptions about music, taste, listening)
- "Captivating algorithms" (design to engage, addict)
- Cultural values (encoded in algorithms)
  - Example: "Discovery" valued (expose to new music)
  - But: Whose discovery? (Western pop privileged)

**Argument:**
- Algorithms = cultural artifacts (made by people, reflect values)
- NOT neutral (shape what we hear, know, like)

---

## Madeleine Clare Elish

### Moral Crumple Zones

**"Moral Crumple Zones in Automated Systems"** (2019):

**Concept:**
- Crumple zone (car safety, absorbs impact)
- Moral crumple zone (human blamed when automation fails)

**Examples:**
- Self-driving car crashes (safety driver blamed, not Tesla)
- Airline autopilot (pilot blamed for not overriding)
- Healthcare AI (doctor blamed for following AI recommendation)

**Argument:**
- Automation (doesn't remove humans, repositions them)
- Humans (absorb blame, legal/moral responsibility)
- Companies (evade accountability)

**Implications:**
- Ethics (who is responsible when AI fails?)
- Regulation (need clear accountability)

---

## Lilly Irani

### Amazon Mechanical Turk

**"Difference and Dependence among Digital Workers"** (2015):
- Indian Mechanical Turk workers

**Findings:**
- Identity (workers see selves as professionals, not microworkers)

- Inequality (global wage differentials, Indian workers paid less)

**Chasing Innovation** (2019):
- Design thinking, innovation hype (India, U.S.)
- Startup culture (meritocracy myth, reproduces inequality)

---

## Safiya Noble (revisited)

### Algorithms of Oppression

**Additional arguments:**
- AI/algorithms (trained on biased data)

- Algorithmic accountability (transparency, audits)

---

## Ruha Benjamin (revisited)

### Race After Technology

**Additional examples:**
- Hiring algorithms (screen out Black names, résumés)

- Healthcare (race-based corrections, structural racism)

**Imagination:**
- Abolitionist tech (design for liberation, not oppression)
- Community-based tech (co-design with affected)
- Refuse harmful tech (say no to dystopian futures)

---

## Anthropology and Automation

### Work Futures

**Displacement:**
- Automation (threatens jobs, manufacturing, service, professional)
- Estimates vary (millions of jobs, contested)

**BUT:**
- History (automation predictions often wrong)
- New jobs created (tech sector, care work)
- Uneven (some jobs automated, others not)

**Anthropology:**
- Ethnographies of displaced workers
- How people adapt, resist, reimagine

---

## Biotechnology

### Genetic Engineering

**CRISPR:**
- Gene editing technology (precise, accessible)
- Applications (medicine, agriculture, research)

**He Jiankui:**
- Chinese scientist (2018)
- Gene-edited babies (HIV resistance)
- International condemnation (jailed)

---

## Kaushik Sunder Rajan

### Biocapital

**Biocapital** (2006):

- "Biocapital" (life itself commodified)

**Argument:**
- Genomics (promises personalized medicine, cures)
- Reality: Speculative (stock markets, venture capital, hype)
- India (clinical trials, genetic databases, exploitation)
- Bodies (become data, sold, traded)

**Implications:**
- Commodification (life, health, futures)
- Inequality (Global South provides data/bodies, North profits)

---

## Adriana Petryna

### Ethical Variability

**When Experiments Travel** (2009):
- Clinical trials (U.S. pharmaceutical companies, Global South)
- "Ethical variability" (regulations vary by country)

**Findings:**
- Outsourcing (trials to countries with lax regulations)
- Exploitation (poor, desperate subjects, minimal compensation)
- Risk (experimental drugs, insufficient oversight)
- Results (used to license drugs in wealthy countries)

**Argument:**
- Global health inequality (bodies exploited for profit)
- "Guinea pigs" (Global South subjects)

---

## Paul Rabinow

### Biosociality

**"Artificiality and Enlightenment"** (1992):
- Biosociality (groups form around genetic conditions)

**Examples:**
- Huntington's disease (genetic, fatal, support groups)
- BRCA genes (breast cancer risk, identity, activism)

**Argument:**
- Biology (becomes basis for identity, politics)

- Extraterrestrial metaphors (ocean = space)

**Anthropology:**
- Science studies (how scientists know, imagine)
- Life (what counts as life, boundaries)

---

## Hannah Landecker

### Culturing Life

**Culturing Life** (2007):
- Cell culture (tissue engineering, immortal cell lines)

**HeLa cells:**
- Henrietta Lacks (Black woman, cervical cancer, 1951)
