# Urban Anthropology: Cities and Theory

---

## Anthropology of Cities vs. Anthropology in Cities

### Fundamental Distinction

**Ulf Hannerz:**
- *Exploring the City* (1980)
- Distinction: Anthropology **of** cities vs. anthropology **in** cities

**Anthropology IN Cities:**
- Using cities as field sites (but not studying cities themselves)
- Studying ethnic groups, migrants, neighborhoods (happens to be urban)
- Traditional approach (treat city as container)

**Anthropology OF Cities:**
- Cities themselves as object of study
- What makes urban life distinctive?
- Urban processes, forms, experiences
- Theorizing urbanism

**Shift:**
- 1960s-1970s: Anthropologists begin studying cities per se
- Not just "peasants in cities" or "urban villages"
- Urban as analytical category

---

## Early Urban Theory

### Chicago School of Sociology

**Context:**
- 1920s-1940s, University of Chicago
- Chicago = laboratory (rapid growth, immigration, industrialization)

**Key Figures:**

**Robert Park:**
- "The City" (1925, essay)
- City = "social laboratory"
- Human ecology (spatial organization, natural areas)

**Louis Wirth:**
- "Urbanism as a Way of Life" (1938)
- Influential essay
- Urban = size, density, heterogeneity
- Effects: Anonymity, superficial relationships, segmented roles, tolerance of diversity
- Contrast rural (gemeinschaft, community) vs. urban (gesellschaft, society)

**Ernest Burgess:**
- Concentric zone model
- Chicago: CBD (center) → zone of transition → working-class zone → residential zone → commuter zone
- Urban expansion (invasion and succession)

**Critiques:**
- Chicago-centric (not universal)
- Ecological determinism (space determines social)
- Ignored power, inequality, capitalism
- Romanticized rural community

**Anthropological Response:**
- Urban villages exist (Herbert Gans, *Urban Villagers*, 1962, Boston Italians)
- Community persists in cities
- Networks, solidarity (not anomie)

---

## Global Cities

### Saskia Sassen

**The Global City** (1991, 2001):
- New York, London, Tokyo (paradigmatic)

**Argument:**
- Globalization creates new urban form
- Command-and-control centers (finance, corporate headquarters)
- Producer services (law, accounting, consulting, advertising)
- Polarization (high-paid professionals + low-paid service workers)
- Immigration (service workers for global elite)
- Spatial: Gentrification + segregation

**Characteristics:**
- Finance dominance (stock markets, banks, investment)
- Global connectivity (more linked to other global cities than own hinterlands)
- Inequality (extreme, dual city)
- Cosmopolitanism (diversity, transnationalism)

**Anthropological Studies:**

**Aihwa Ong:**
- Hong Kong, Singapore
- Global cities, Chinese capitalism

**Michael Peter Smith:**
- Transnationalism from below (migrants in global cities)

---

## Informality

### Global South Urbanism

**Context:**
- Majority of world's urban population = Global South
- Rapid urbanization (rural-urban migration)
- Limited formal employment, housing

**Informality:**
- Economic: Informal sector (street vendors, day labor, unregistered businesses)
- Housing: Informal settlements (slums, favelas, barrios, townships)
- Infrastructure: Self-built (water, electricity, often illegal connections)

**NOT:**
- "Pre-modern" or "traditional"
- Temporary (often permanent, generational)
- Outside the system (connected to formal economy, state)

**Estimates:**
- ~1 billion people live in slums globally (UN-Habitat)
- Majority of urban growth = informal settlements

---

## Janice Perlman and Rio de Janeiro

### Classic Study

**The Myth of Marginality** (1976):
- Rio de Janeiro favelas (1960s-1970s)

**Argument:**
- Dominant view: Favela residents = marginal (economically, socially, politically)
  - Unproductive, criminogenic, disorganized
  - Modernization theory: Backward, need integration
- Perlman: **Myth**
  - Economically: Integrated (work formal economy, exploited, low wages)
  - Socially: Organized (associations, networks, solidarity)
  - Politically: Aspire to participation (blocked by system)
  - Culturally: NOT traditional (share modern aspirations)

**Marginality:**
- NOT marginal to system
- Marginalized BY system (repression, exploitation)

**Follow-up:**
- *Favela* (2010)
  - Return after 40 years
  - Same families, next generation
  - Violence increased (drug trade, police)
  - Inequality persists

---

## Mike Davis

### Planet of Slums

**Planet of Slums** (2006):
- Polemical, global survey

**Argument:**
- "Urbanization of poverty"
- Neoliberalism = slum growth (structural adjustment, austerity)
- IMF/World Bank policies (cut public services, housing)
- Informal settlements explode (Lagos, Mumbai, Mexico City, São Paulo, Manila, Karachi, etc.)
- Dystopian future (inequality, violence, environmental degradation)

**Critiques:**
- Overly pessimistic (ignores agency, resilience)
- Homogenizes (diverse realities)
- Limited ethnography (synthesizes others' work)

**BUT:**
- Influential
- Highlights structural forces (neoliberalism, inequality)

---

## AbdouMaliq Simone

### Johannesburg

**For the City Yet to Come** (2004):
- Johannesburg, South Africa (post-apartheid)

**Concept:**
- "People as infrastructure"
- Absence of formal infrastructure (reliable services)
- People themselves = infrastructure (networks, improvisation, collaboration)
- Social relationships enable survival, opportunity

**Examples:**
- Street traders (sharing space, information, security)
- Informal transport (minibus taxis, networks)
- Electricity sharing (illegal connections, pooled costs)

**Urbanism:**
- Improvisation, flexibility, creativity
- Precarity, uncertainty
- NOT deficiency (different logic)

---

## Non-Places

### Marc Augé

**Non-Places** (1992, French; 1995, English):
- Anthropology of "supermodernity"

**Non-Places:**
- Spaces of transit, transience, anonymity
- Examples: Airports, highways, hotel chains, supermarkets, shopping malls
- Contrast: Places (identity, relational, historical)
- Non-places: Interchangeable, generic, temporary

**Characteristics:**
- Instructions (signs, screens, directions)
- Solitary (individuals, not community)
- Contractual (tickets, cards, consumer relations)

**Paris Metro:**
- Augé's example
- Commuters (isolated, anonymous)
- Advertisements, signs (mediated experience)

**Critiques:**
- Oversimplified (people make places in non-places)
- Romanticizes traditional places
- BUT: Useful concept (anonymity, transit, modernity)

---

## Akhil Gupta and James Ferguson

### Space and Place

**"Culture, Power, Place"** (1992, article; 1997, in edited volume):
- Critique of anthropology's spatial assumptions

**Argument:**
- Anthropology traditionally assumes:
  - Cultures = bounded, localized, rooted in places
  - "The field" = distant, isolated place
- Problem: Migration, globalization, media (deterritorialization)
- Space = produced (not given)
- Place ≠ culture (many cultures in one place, one culture in many places)

**Implications:**
- Urban anthropology: Cities = NOT cultureless or chaotic
- Cities = sites of place-making (multiple, contested)

---

## Setha Low

### Public Space

**On the Plaza** (2000):
- San José, Costa Rica (central plaza)

**Argument:**
- Public space = socially produced
- **Social production:** Political-economic processes (creation, management, control)
- **Social construction:** Meaning-making (experiences, memories, symbols)

**Methodology:**
- Ethnography + spatial analysis
- Observe plaza use (who, when, how)
- Interviews (memories, meanings)
- Historical analysis (changes over time)

**"Gated Communities":**
- Low also studied (U.S., Latin America)
- Privatization of public space
- Fear, security, exclusion
- Class segregation

---

## Loïc Wacquant

### Advanced Marginality

**Urban Outcasts** (2008):
- Comparative: Chicago (Black ghetto) + Paris (banlieues, immigrant suburbs)

**Argument:**
- NOT simple comparison
- Neoliberalism = new urban poverty ("advanced marginality")
- Characteristics:
  - Work precarity (deindustrialization, flexible labor)
  - Territorial stigmatization (neighborhoods = degraded symbols)
  - Spatial relegation (concentrated poverty, segregation)
  - Loss of place (community dissolves)
  - State penalization (policing, incarceration, not welfare)

**Differences:**
- U.S.: Racial (Black ghetto, caste)
- France: Immigrant, ethnic (but not official racial categories)

**Similarities:**
- Neoliberal policies (withdraw social support, increase policing)
- Marginalization, exclusion

---

## Provisioning the City

### Infrastructure and Services

**Anthropology of Infrastructure:**
- How cities work (or don't)
- Water, electricity, transportation, waste
- Political (who gets access, quality)
- Breakdown, repair, improvisation

**Examples:**

**Anand Nikhil:**
- Mumbai water (informal settlements, tanker trucks, politics)

**Brian Larkin:**
- Nigeria infrastructure (roads, media, telecommunications)
- *Signal and Noise* (2008)

**Stephen Graham & Simon Marvin:**
- "Splintering urbanism" (2001)
- Infrastructure fragmentation (premium networked spaces vs. bypassed areas)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is Wirth's "urbanism as a way of life" still relevant?

**Question 2:** Are informal settlements problems or solutions?

**Question 3:** What is a "global city" and does the concept help or obscure?

**Question 4:** Can anthropology theorize "the city" or only specific cities?

**Question 5:** Are non-places truly placeless?
