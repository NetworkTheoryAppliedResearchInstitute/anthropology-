## Pedagogical Approach

### Narrative-First Learning
Rather than traditional definitions and bullet points, content emphasizes:
- **Ethnographic storytelling** that makes abstract concepts concrete
- **Defamiliarization techniques** that question familiar assumptions
- **Multiple perspectives** on contested theoretical terrain
- **Contemporary connections** linking historical insights to current issues

### Conversational Instruction Design
Content is structured to enable AI instructors to:
- Ask provocative Socratic questions
- Share relevant ethnographic examples
- Present multiple theoretical interpretations
- Adapt complexity to learner level
- Connect concepts across subfields and topics

### Cultural Sensitivity
All content maintains:
- Respect for diverse cultural practices and worldviews
- Reflexivity about anthropology's colonial history
- Contemporary indigenous perspectives
- Nuanced treatment of sensitive topics
- Avoidance of essentializing generalizations
