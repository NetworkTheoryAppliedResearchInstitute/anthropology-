# Primate Diversity and Social Organization

---

## Why Study Primates?

### Our Closest Relatives

**Reasons:**
- Evolutionary context (what we share, what's unique to humans)
- Model human behavior (carefully!)
- Conservation (endangered)
- Intrinsic interest (fascinating!)

**Comparative Method:**
- Understand humans by comparison
- What traits are shared (ancient)?
- What evolved uniquely (recent)?

**Caution:**
- Primates ≠ "primitive humans"
- They evolved too
- Each species adapted to own niche

## Social Organization Patterns

### Diversity of Social Systems

**Why Study Social Organization?**
- Adaptation to ecology
- Mating strategies
- Predator defense
- Resource competition

**Barbara Smuts, Robert Seyfarth, Dorothy Cheney:**
- "Primate Societies" (1987)
- Synthesis

---

## Solitary

**Examples:**
- Orangutans (mostly)
- Some lemurs, lorises

**Pattern:**
- Individuals forage alone
- Meet only to mate
- Mothers with infants

**Why?**
- Dispersed food resources
- Competition for food

**Orangutans:**
- Males especially solitary
- Large home ranges
- "Lone ape"
- But: not totally isolated
- Flexible

---

## Pair-Bonded (Monogamy)

**Examples:**
- Gibbons, siamangs
- Some lemurs
- Titi monkeys
- Owl monkeys

**Pattern:**
- Male-female pair
- Shared territory
- Both care for offspring
- Long-term bonds

**Why?**
- Male parental care beneficial
- Dispersed resources (can't support group)
- Infant care demands

**Gibbons:**
- Duets (singing together)
- Defend territory
- Lifelong pairs (often)

**Rare in Primates:**
- ~15% of species
- Rare in mammals generally

---

## Single-Male, Multi-Female (Uni-Male Groups)

**Examples:**
- Gorillas
- Hamadryas baboons
- Geladas
- Langurs

**Pattern:**
- One adult male
- Multiple females
- Offspring
- Male monopolizes mating

**Why?**
- Male can defend females
- Females benefit from male protection

**Gorillas:**
- Silverback male
- 5-10 females
- Offspring
- Peaceful (mostly)
- Male succession (infanticide risk)

**Langurs:**
- Male takeovers
- Infanticide (Sarah Hrdy research)
- Speeds female return to estrus
- Shocking discovery (1970s)

---

## Multi-Male, Multi-Female Groups

**Examples:**
- Chimpanzees
- Bonobos
- Most baboons
- Macaques
- Spider monkeys

**Pattern:**
- Multiple adult males
- Multiple adult females
- Complex hierarchies
- Flexible

**Why?**
- Predator defense (many eyes)
- Resource defense
- Coalition formation

**Chimpanzees:**
- 20-100+ individuals
- Fission-fusion (subgroups fluid)
- Male dominance hierarchies
- Female transfer (leave natal group)
- Male kin bonds

**Baboons:**
- Savanna baboons
- 50-200 individuals
- Linear dominance hierarchies
- Shirley Strum, Barbara Smuts research

---

## Fission-Fusion

**Definition:**
- Group size/composition changes
- Subgroups split and merge
- Flexible

**Examples:**
- Chimpanzees (classic)
- Bonobos
- Spider monkeys

**Chimpanzees:**
- Community (total group)
- Parties (foraging subgroups)
- Size varies daily
- Males together often
- Females more solitary (with infants)

**Why?**
- Fruit patches (size varies)
- Optimal foraging
- Reduce competition

---

## Mating Systems

### Reproductive Strategies

**Monogamy:**
- Pair bonds
- Low sexual dimorphism
- Gibbons

**Polygyny (One Male, Multiple Females):**
- Male competition intense
- High sexual dimorphism (males larger)
- Gorillas, orangutans

**Polyandry (One Female, Multiple Males):**
- Rare in primates
- Tamarins/marmosets (cooperative breeding)
- Males help raise offspring

**Promiscuity:**
- Multiple mates for both sexes
- Sperm competition
- Chimpanzees, bonobos
- Large testes (sperm competition)

---

## Sexual Dimorphism

### Size Differences

**Definition:**
- Males and females differ in size/appearance

**Patterns:**

**Low Dimorphism:**
- Monogamy (gibbons)
- Males and females similar size
- Little male competition

**High Dimorphism:**
- Polygyny (gorillas, baboons)
- Males much larger (2x females, gorillas)
- Intense male competition
- Fighting, display

**Intermediate:**
- Chimps, bonobos
- Males larger but not extreme

**Canine Size:**
- Males often have larger canines
- Fighting
- Threat display

---

## Dominance Hierarchies

### Rank and Status

**Definition:**
- Social rank
- Who defers to whom
- Access to resources, mates

**Linear Hierarchies:**
- Clear ranking (A>B>B>C...)
- Baboons, macaques

**Coalition-Based:**
- Alliances shift power
- Chimps (alpha needs support)

**Female Hierarchies:**
- Often matrilineal
- Mothers pass rank to daughters
- Macaques, baboons

**Alison Jolly:**
- Lemurs
- Female dominance (unusual in mammals)
- Females feed first

---

## Kin Selection and Altruism

### Helping Relatives

**W.D. Hamilton:**
- Kin selection theory

**Primates:**
- Groom kin more
- Defend kin
- Share food (some)
- Female philopatry (stay with kin)

**Examples:**

- Chimp males (brothers) ally
- Vervet alarm calls

---

## Communication

### Vocalizations

**Alarm Calls:**
- Warn about predators
- Vervets (Thomas Struhsaker, Dorothy Cheney, Robert Seyfarth)
  - Different calls for eagles, leopards, snakes
  - Appropriate responses (look up, look down, stand up)
  - Semantic? (referential)

**Food Calls:**
- Chimps (pant-hoots at food)
- Recruit others

**Contact Calls:**
- Maintain group cohesion
- Chimps (pant-hoots)

**Not Language:**
- Limited repertoire
- No syntax (grammar)
- Mostly innate (some learning)

### Gestures

**Apes Gesture:**
- Intentional
- Learn from others
- Flexible use

**Examples:**
- Chimps: begging hand
- Bonobos: sexual invitations
- Gorillas: chest-beat (males)

**Michael Tomasello:**
- Ape gestures
- More flexible than calls
- Intentional communication

### Facial Expressions

**Shared with Humans:**
- Play face (like smile)
- Fear grin (submission)
- Threat face (canines bared)

**Emotions:**
- Darwin: continuity with humans
- Expressions evolved

---

## Grooming and Social Bonds

### Maintaining Relationships

**Grooming:**
- Remove parasites (functional)
- But: social bonding primary

**Patterns:**
- Reciprocal (trade)
- Groom up hierarchy (subordinates → dominants)
- Kin groom more
- Coalition partners groom

**Robin Dunbar:**
- Grooming creates bonds
- Time-consuming
- Language evolved as "vocal grooming"? (hypothesis)

---

## Aggression and Conflict

- Competition

**Chimpanzees:**
- Meat sharing (after hunt)
- Males share with allies, females
- Tolerated scrounging

**Bonobos:**

---

## Primate Life Histories

### Slow and Long

**Compared to Other Mammals:**
- Long gestation
- Slow growth
- Long juvenile period
- Long lifespan
- Few offspring

**K-Selection:**
- Quality over quantity
- Invest heavily in few offspring

**Examples:**
- Chimp: 8 months gestation, ~5 years nursing, sexual maturity 12-15 years
- Human: 9 months gestation, 2-4 years nursing, sexual maturity 12-18 years

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Do primate studies tell us about "human nature" or not?

**Question 2:** Is monogamy "natural" based on primate data?

**Question 3:** Should we project human concepts (friendship, culture) onto primates?

**Question 4:** What does primate social organization teach about human evolution?

**Question 5:** Are humans just "the third chimpanzee" (Jared Diamond)?

**Remember:** ~500 living primate species show enormous diversity. Major groups: strepsirrhines (lemurs, lorises), haplorhines (tarsiers, monkeys, apes). Social organization varies: solitary (orangutans), pair-bonded monogamy (gibbons ~15%), single-male groups (gorillas, langurs with infanticide risk), multi-male/multi-female (baboons, macaques, chimps). Fission-fusion (chimps, bonobos). Mating systems from monogamy to promiscuity. Sexual dimorphism linked to mating competition. Dominance hierarchies, kin selection, altruism. Communication: vervet alarm calls (semantic?), ape gestures intentional. Grooming maintains social bonds. Aggression ritualized, reconciliation (de Waal). Cooperation: coalitions, group hunting. Mother-infant bonds strong, long dependency. Male care rare except marmosets/tamarins. Food sharing rare, chimps share meat. Slow life histories (K-selection). Understanding primate social organization reveals evolutionary context for human behavior—we share many traits but also unique features.
