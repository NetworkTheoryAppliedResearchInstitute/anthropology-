# Writing Culture: The Postmodern Crisis and Reflexive Turn (1980s)

---

## The Crisis of Confidence

In 1986, a conference and resulting book—***Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography***—detonated a bomb in anthropology.

**The Explosive Question:** If ethnographies are constructed texts (not transparent windows on reality), shaped by rhetoric and power, written from positioned perspectives (not objective viewpoints), what is the status of anthropological knowledge?

This triggered what's called the **"crisis of representation"**—a profound questioning of ethnographic authority, objectivity, and truth claims that transformed anthropology.

**For some:** Liberating reflexivity and experimental possibilities

**For others:** Paralyzing self-doubt and navel-gazing

**For everyone:** Anthropology would never be the same.

## What Sparked the Crisis?

### Multiple Converging Critiques (1970s-1980s)

**1. Postcolonial Critique:**
- Edward Said's *Orientalism* (1978): "Objective" scholarship about the Orient was actually Western power/knowledge constructing the exotic Other
- Anthropology implicated in colonialism
- Who has authority to represent whom?

**2. Feminist Critique:**
- Male anthropologists claiming to speak for whole cultures while talking mainly to men
- Androcentrism masked as objectivity
- Whose perspective counts?

**3. Indigenous Critique:**
- Vine Deloria Jr.'s *Custer Died for Your Sins* (1969): Anthropologists as exploiters
- Indigenous peoples rejecting anthropological representation
- We can speak for ourselves

**4. Poststructuralism and Postmodernism:**
- Jacques Derrida: All texts are unstable, no fixed meanings
- Michel Foucault: Knowledge is power
- Jean-François Lyotard: Skepticism toward grand narratives
- Literary theory influencing anthropology

**5. Internal Anthropological Reflexivity:**
- Clifford Geertz showing ethnography is interpretation
- Recognition that anthropologist affects field site
- Growing awareness of rhetorical construction

**These converged into fundamental questioning.**

## *Writing Culture* (1986): The Manifesto

### Editors: James Clifford and George Marcus

**The Book's Arguments:**

**1. Ethnographies Are Texts:**

Not transparent representations of reality but:
- Constructed narratives
- Using literary conventions
- Rhetorical strategies
- Narrative techniques

**Like novels, not scientific reports.**

**2. Ethnographic Authority is Constructed:**

How do ethnographers convince readers?

**"Being There" Authority (Malinowski):**
- "I was there, lived with them, saw it myself"
- Personal experience validates claims
- But: Selective, partial, positioned

**Interpretive Authority (Geertz):**
- "I understood the meanings, I can explain"
- Interpretive expertise validates claims
- But: Whose interpretation? Why anthropologist's over native's?

**Dialogic Authority:**
- Presenting multiple voices
- But: Anthropologist still selects, edits, frames

**All are rhetorical constructions, not natural authority.**

**3. The Ethnographer as Author:**

The writer's choices shape what we know:
- What to include/exclude
- Whose voices to feature
- How to structure narrative
- Tone and style

**These are **literary** decisions, not just scientific ones.**

**4. Power and Representation:**

Who gets to represent whom?
- Western anthropologists representing non-Western peoples
- Educated elites representing working classes
- Men representing women
- Outsiders representing insiders

**This is **political**, not neutral.**

**5. Partial Truths:**

All ethnographies are:
- Partial (incomplete, not total)
- Partial (positioned, not neutral)
- Situated knowledges (Donna Haraway)

**No "view from nowhere"—always a view from somewhere.**

## Key Essays and Arguments

### James Clifford: "On Ethnographic Authority"

**Four Modes of Ethnographic Authority:**

**1. Experiential:** "I was there" (Malinowski's authority)

**2. Interpretive:** "I understand meanings" (Geertz's authority)

**3. Dialogical:** "Multiple voices" (new experimental forms)

**4. Polyphonic:** "Natives speak for themselves" (collaborative ethnography)

**Each has problems:**
- Experiential: Subjective, limited
- Interpretive: Why anthropologist's interpretation over native's?
- Dialogical: Anthropologist still controls
- Polyphonic: Anthropologist still edits

**No escape from power and construction.**

### Stephen Tyler: "Post-Modern Ethnography"

**Radical proposal:**

**Abandon:**
- Representation (can't represent reality)
- Objectivity (always positioned)
- Authority (don't speak for others)

**Instead:**
- Evocation (evoke experiences, don't represent)
- Dialogue (conversation, not monologue)
- Fragment (resist totalization)
- Experimental forms

**Ethnography should be:**
- Collaborative
- Self-conscious
- Textual experiment
- Evocative, not explanatory

### Vincent Crapanzano: "Hermes' Dilemma"

**The messenger god's problem:**

**Anthropologist as translator:**
- Translates between cultures
- But: Translation is transformation
- Always betrays original
- Hermes must choose: Fidelity or intelligibility?

**The Dilemma:**
- Faithful to natives' meanings = unintelligible to Western audience
- Intelligible to Western audience = transforms natives' meanings

**No solution—just awareness of the problem.**

## The Feminist Response: "Where Are the Women?"

### Feminists Critiqued *Writing Culture* Itself:

**1. Mostly Male Authors:**
Only 1 woman contributor (Mary Pratt, literary scholar, not anthropologist).

**2. Ignored Feminist Experimental Ethnography:**
Women anthropologists had been doing experimental, reflexive, dialogic ethnography for years:
- Marjorie Shostak's *Nisa* (1981): Life history, Nisa's voice
- Jean Briggs, Lila Abu-Lughod, etc.

**3. Textuality Obscures Material Reality:**
Focusing on texts risks ignoring:
- Real inequality
- Material oppression
- Power beyond representation

**Ruth Behar and Deborah Gordon, *Women Writing Culture* (1995):**
Feminist counter-volume showing women's experimental ethnography.

**Mascia-Lees, Sharpe, and Cohen:**
"Postmodernism is a luxury of privileged position—women and minorities experience material oppression, not just representational issues."

**The Point:** Reflexivity important, but can't be only focus. **Material power matters.**

---

## Experimental Ethnographies

### New Forms Emerged:

**1. Multi-Voiced Texts:**

> **Kevin Dwyer, *Moroccan Dialogues* (1982):**
> Presents conversations between anthropologist and informant unedited, showing power dynamics and miscommunication.

**2. Autobiographical/Confessional:**

> **Paul Rabinow, *Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco* (1977):**
> Honest about fieldwork difficulties, mistakes, subjectivity.

> **Jean-Paul Dumont, *The Headman and I* (1978):**
> Relationship with key informant, power and friendship dynamics.

**3. Life Histories:**

> **Marjorie Shostak, *Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman* (1981):**
> Nisa's own narrative, anthropologist as recorder.

**4. Performance Ethnography:**

> **Dwight Conquergood:** Ethnography as performance, embodied knowledge.

**5. Visual Anthropology:**

> **David MacDougall, *Wedding Camels* (1977):**
> Film as ethnographic medium, different representational possibilities.

**6. Fiction-Ethnography Blends:**

> **Michael Taussig:** Surrealist ethnography, experimental prose.

## Critiques of Writing Culture Approach

### 1. Paralysis Through Reflexivity

**Critique:** If all ethnography is partial, positioned, constructed—can we say anything?

**Risk:** Self-doubt prevents making any claims.

**Response:** Reflexivity shouldn't mean paralysis. Positioned knowledge is still knowledge.

### 2. Navel-Gazing

**Critique:** Too much attention to anthropologist's experience, not enough to people studied.

**Risk:** Ethnography becomes autobiography.

**Response:** Reflexivity should contextualize knowledge, not replace it.

### 3. Ignoring Material Reality

**Critique:** Focusing on representation risks ignoring:
- Real poverty
- Actual violence
- Material inequality
- Urgent political issues

**Nancy Scheper-Hughes:** "Where's the body?" Need embodied, engaged anthropology.

### 4. Elite Academic Obscurantism

**Critique:** Postmodern writing is:
- Jargon-heavy
- Difficult to read
- Accessible only to elite academics
- Politically ineffective

**Response:** True, but reflexivity can be expressed clearly.

### 5. Nothing New?

**Critique:** Haven't anthropologists always known ethnography is partial, positioned, constructed?

**Response:** Yes, but Writing Culture made it explicit and central, couldn't be ignored.

## What Changed After Writing Culture

### Positive Changes:

**1. Reflexivity Now Standard:**
Contemporary ethnographies routinely:
- Discuss positionality
- Acknowledge partiality
- Reflect on power dynamics
- Consider representation politics

**2. Collaborative Methods:**
More anthropologists work collaboratively with communities:
- Co-authorship
- Community review
- Participatory research

**3. Diverse Voices:**
More attention to:
- Multiple perspectives within communities
- Indigenous anthropologists
- Insider perspectives
- Challenging ethnographic authority

**4. Writing Styles:**
More experimental, literary, personal writing accepted.

**5. Ethical Awareness:**
More conscious of power in representation.

### Problems That Persisted:

**1. Academic Privilege Unchanged:**
Anthropologists still mostly Western academics studying non-Western peoples.

**2. Institutional Power:**
Anthropologists still control:
- Publication
- Careers
- Funding
- Definitions of knowledge

**3. Whose Voices?**
Even "polyphonic" ethnographies edited by anthropologist.

**4. Material Inequality:**
Textual reflexivity doesn't solve material exploitation.

## Key Debates

### Objectivity vs. Subjectivity

**Traditional View:** Ethnography should be objective.

**Postmodern View:** Objectivity is impossible—embrace positioned knowledge.

**Middle Ground:** Intersubjectivity—shared understanding between anthropologist and informants.

### Representation vs. Advocacy

**Question:** Should anthropologists represent or advocate?

**Traditional:** Neutral observation and description.

**Engaged:** Take political stands, support struggles.

**Postmodern:** Representation itself is political.

**Nancy Scheper-Hughes, "Primacy of the Ethical":**
Anthropologists have ethical obligation to engaged witness—can't be neutral.

### Science vs. Humanities

**Writing Culture pushed anthropology toward humanities:**
- Interpretation over explanation
- Texts over data
- Hermeneutics over hypothesis testing

**But some anthropologists resisted:** Anthropology should be science, not literature.

**Ongoing tension.**

## Legacy: Where Are We Now?

### Contemporary Anthropology Post-Writing Culture:

**Keeps:**
- Reflexivity about positionality
- Awareness of textual construction
- Attention to power in representation
- Questioning of authority

**Adds:**
- Material analysis (political economy)
- Structural violence (inequality matters)
- Engaged anthropology (advocacy)
- Historical context

**Rejects:**
- Pure textualism (culture isn't just text)
- Extreme relativism (some things are true)
- Paralysis (can still make claims)
- Apolitical stance (must engage power)

### "Post-Postmodern"?

**Contemporary trends:**

**1. Ontological Turn:** Different realities, not just different representations (controversial).

**2. Multispecies Ethnography:** Humans aren't only agents—animals, plants, things matter.

**3. Affect Theory:** Emotions, bodies, feelings—beyond just meaning and representation.

**4. New Materialism:** Matter has agency, not just meaning.

**5. Digital Ethnography:** New field sites and methods.

**But all still marked by Writing Culture's reflexivity.**

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** If all knowledge is partial and positioned, does that mean all views are equally valid? How do we adjudicate between conflicting accounts?

**Question 2:** Can anthropologists both critique ethnographic authority AND make truth claims? Or is this contradictory?

**Question 3:** Does reflexivity strengthen or weaken anthropology's political effectiveness?

**Question 4:** Should anthropologists prioritize representation fidelity or political solidarity with people studied?

**Question 5:** Has the crisis of representation been resolved, or are we still in crisis?

**Remember:** Writing Culture didn't destroy anthropology—it made anthropology more self-aware, more reflexive, more honest about power and partiality. We can't return to naive realism (pretending ethnography is objective mirror of reality). But we also can't retreat into pure textualism (ignoring material reality and political stakes). Contemporary anthropology tries to balance: being reflexive about positioned perspectives while still making truth claims; acknowledging textual construction while attending to material conditions; questioning authority while still producing knowledge. The crisis may be permanent—but that's not failure. It's maturity, recognizing the complexity of representing human diversity while still doing it as carefully and ethically as possible.
