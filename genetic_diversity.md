# Genetic Diversity and Population Genetics: Molecular Evidence

---

## Human Genetic Diversity is LOW

### Compared to Other Species

**Surprising Fact:**
- Humans less genetically diverse than chimps
- Chimps more diverse than all humans
- Other great apes too

**Why?**
- Recent origin (common ancestor ~300,000 years ago)
- Population bottleneck(s)
- Rapid expansion
- Little time for mutations to accumulate

**Implications:**
- We're all closely related
- Recent African origin
- "Races" can't be deeply different

---

## Population Bottleneck

### Near Extinction?

**Genetic Evidence:**
- Low diversity suggests small population
- ~10,000-30,000 individuals (estimated)
- ~70,000 years ago

**Toba Supervolcano (74,000 years ago):**
- Sumatra
- Massive eruption
- "Volcanic winter"
- Nearly wiped out humans?
- Debated

**Founder Effect:**
- Small group leaves Africa
- Carries subset of genetic diversity
- Non-Africans less diverse than Africans

## Measuring Genetic Diversity

### Tools and Methods

**Genetic Markers:**

**1. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA):**
- Maternal inheritance
- No recombination
- Traces female lineages
- "Mitochondrial Eve"

**2. Y-Chromosome:**
- Paternal inheritance
- No recombination
- Traces male lineages
- "Y-Chromosome Adam"

**3. Autosomal DNA:**
- Both parents
- Recombines
- Most genetic information
- SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)

**4. Ancient DNA:**
- Extract from fossils
- Revolutionary
- Neanderthal, Denisovan genomes
- Ancient human populations

---

## Mitochondrial Eve

### Most Recent Common Female Ancestor

**Concept:**
- All humans trace mtDNA to one woman
- Lived ~150,000-200,000 years ago
- Africa

**NOT First Woman:**
- Others existed
- But: only her mtDNA lineage survived
- Coalescence (lineages merge going back)

**Implications:**
- African origin
- Supports Out of Africa

**Rebecca Cann, Mark Stoneking, Allan Wilson (1987):**
- Pioneering study
- mtDNA diversity
- African origin

---

## Y-Chromosome Adam

### Most Recent Common Male Ancestor

**Parallel to Mt Eve:**
- All men trace Y chromosome to one man
- Lived ~200,000-300,000 years ago
- Africa

**Different Date:**
- Adam older than Eve? (or vice versa, debated)
- Different mutation rates
- Selection pressures

**Male-Driven Migration:**
- Y chromosome shows patterns
- Male-biased dispersal (in some cases)

---

## African Genetic Diversity

### Africa Has MOST Diversity

**Key Finding:**
- African populations most genetically diverse
- Non-Africans are subset
- Founder effect

**Implications:**
- Africa = ancestral home
- Longest human occupation
- Most time for mutation

**San (Khoisan) Peoples:**
- Southern Africa
- Among most diverse genetically
- Deep lineages
- Ancient population

**Sarah Tishkoff:**
- African genetic diversity research
- Complex population structure
- Multiple migrations within Africa

---

## Population Structure

### Patterns of Variation

**Isolation by Distance:**
- Geographically close populations more similar
- Gene flow decreases with distance
- Wright's F-statistics (FST)

**Genetic Clusters:**
- Statistical methods (STRUCTURE software)
- Can identify continental clusters
- BUT: continuous variation
- Clusters ≠ races (arbitrary K value)

**Noah Rosenberg:**
- Global genetic variation
- Clusters correspond to geography
- Not discrete categories

---

## Clinal Variation

### Gradients, Not Boundaries

**Cline:**
- Gradual change across space
- No sharp boundaries

**Examples:**

**Skin Color:**
- Latitude gradient
- Continuous

**Lactase Persistence:**
- High in Northern Europe
- Gradual decrease
- High in East African pastoralists

**ABO Blood Types:**
- Different frequencies globally
- Gradients
- Don't correlate with "race"

---

## Ancient DNA Revolution

### Paleogenomics

**Svante Pääbo:**
- Nobel Prize 2022
- Neanderthal genome (2010)
- Denisovan genome (2010)
- Ancient DNA techniques

**What We've Learned:**

**1. Interbreeding:**
- Neanderthals (2% in non-Africans)
- Denisovans (up to 5% in some)
- Complex admixture

**2. Ghost Populations:**
- Unknown archaic hominins
- Africa (suggested by DNA)
- Asian "super-archaics"

**3. Migration Patterns:**
- Multiple waves out of Africa
- Back-migrations to Africa
- Complex, not simple

**4. Population Replacements:**
- Britain: multiple turnovers
- Steppe migration (Bronze Age)
- Population dynamics

**David Reich:**
- "Who We Are and How We Got Here"
- Ancient DNA insights
- Three ancestral populations (West Eurasians, East Asians, Africans)
- But: continuous mixing

---

## Admixture and Hybridization

### We're All Mixed

**No "Pure" Populations:**
- All humans mixed ancestry
- Recent and ancient admixture

**Examples:**

**African Americans:**
- African ancestry (~80% average)
- European ancestry (~20%)
- Native American (some)
- Highly variable

**Latinx:**
- European, Indigenous, African
- Mestizaje
- Complex mixtures

**Uyghurs (China):**
- East Asian + West Eurasian
- Silk Road mixing

**Implications:**
- "Purity" = myth
- Mixing = normal
- White nationalism's genetic claims false

---

## Genetic Distance

### How Different Are Populations?

**FST (Fixation Index):**
- Measure of genetic differentiation
- 0 = identical
- 1 = completely different

**Human FST:**
- Between continental groups: ~0.10-0.15
- LOW!
- Compare:
  - Chimps: higher
  - Dogs: much higher (breeds)

**Humans more uniform than dog breeds:**
- Despite looking different
- Shows variation superficial

---

## Natural Selection in Humans

### Recent Evolution

**Examples of Selection:**

**Lactase Persistence:**
- Strong, recent selection
- 5,000-10,000 years
- Independent mutations

**Malaria Resistance:**
- Sickle cell, thalassemia
- Balanced selection
- Heterozygote advantage

**Skin Color:**
- Directional selection
- UV radiation
- Recent (<100,000 years)

**High Altitude:**
- Tibetan EPAS1
- Andean EGLN1
- Strong selection

**EDAR Gene (East Asia):**
- Affects hair, teeth, sweat glands
- Selected ~30,000 years ago
- Why? Unknown

**Detecting Selection:**
- Selective sweeps
- Extended haplotypes
- Low diversity around selected gene

---

## Neutral Variation

### Most Variation is Neutral

**Neutral Theory (Motoo Kimura):**
- Most mutations neutral (no effect)
- Drift, not selection
- "Molecular clock"

**Implications:**
- Much variation not adaptive
- Genetic drift important
- Random change

**Selection vs. Drift:**
- Hard to distinguish
- Both operate
- Most variation likely neutral

---

## Genetic Ancestry Testing

### Direct-to-Consumer Tests

**Companies:**
- 23andMe, AncestryDNA, etc.
- Analyze DNA
- Provide ancestry estimates

**What They Do:**
- Compare to reference panels
- Estimate continental ancestry percentages
- Haplogroups

**Problems:**

**1. Reference Panels:**
- Who's included?
- Biased samples
- "European" ≠ all Europeans

**2. Arbitrary Percentages:**
- "32% Irish" meaningless
- Algorithms differ
- Can change with updates

**3. Reinforce Race:**
- Percentages seem scientific
- Imply discrete categories
- Reify race

**4. Privacy:**
- DNA database
- Law enforcement
- Consent issues (Golden State Killer)

**Alondra Nelson:**
- "The Social Life of DNA"
- African Americans seeking roots
- Complex meanings

**Deborah Bolnick:**
- Genetic ancestry critique
- Limitations, misunderstandings

---

## Pharmacogenomics

### Drugs and Genetics

**Precision Medicine:**
- Tailor treatment to genetics
- Drug response varies

**Examples:**
- Warfarin (blood thinner): dosage varies
- Abacavir (HIV drug): HLA-B*5701 test
- CYP450 enzymes (drug metabolism)

**Race-Based Medicine:**
- BiDil (heart failure, marketed to African Americans)
- Controversial
- Race poor proxy for genetics

**Better Approach:**
- Individual genotyping
- Not racial categories
- Geographic ancestry if needed

---

## Epigenetics and Inheritance

### Beyond DNA Sequence

**Epigenetic Marks:**
- DNA methylation
- Histone modifications
- Affect gene expression
- Can be inherited

**Environmental Effects:**
- Famine (Dutch Hunger Winter)
- Stress
- Trauma?
- Transmitted to offspring

**"Soft Inheritance":**
- Lamarckian element
- Acquired characteristics partially heritable
- Darwin didn't rule out

**Controversies:**
- How much inherited?
- How many generations?
- Debated

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Does genetic ancestry testing help or harm understanding of race?

**Question 2:** Should we use race in medicine, or only individual genetics?

**Question 3:** What does "genetic diversity" mean for conservation, immigration?

**Question 4:** If we're all so genetically similar, why so much conflict?

**Question 5:** How would you react to finding unexpected ancestry in DNA test?

**Remember:** Human genetic diversity is LOW compared to other species—recent origin, bottleneck, rapid expansion. Population bottleneck ~70,000 years ago (Toba?), founder effect leaving Africa. Mitochondrial Eve (~150-200 kya Africa) and Y-Chromosome Adam trace lineages. Africa has MOST genetic diversity—supports African origin. Lewontin: 85% variation within populations, 15% between. Clinal variation (gradients) not discrete boundaries. Ancient DNA revolution (Pääbo Nobel 2022): Neanderthal/Denisovan interbreeding, ghost populations, complex migrations, no pure populations. Reich's insights on admixture—all mixed. FST between human continental groups low (~0.10-0.15), less than dog breeds. Recent natural selection (lactase, malaria resistance, skin color, altitude). Neutral theory—most variation not adaptive. Genetic ancestry tests problematic (arbitrary percentages, reinforce race, privacy). Pharmacogenomics—race poor proxy, individual genetics better. Epigenetics—environmental effects can be inherited. Understanding genetic diversity reveals humans unified recent species, African origin, superficial variation, mixing normal—genetics undermines race, shows common humanity.
