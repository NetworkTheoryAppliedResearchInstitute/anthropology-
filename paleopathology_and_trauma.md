# Paleopathology and Trauma: Reading Disease and Violence from Bones

---

## What Is Paleopathology?

### Study of Ancient Disease

**Definition:**
- Paleo = ancient
- Pathology = disease
- Study disease in past populations

**Sources:**
- Skeletal remains
- Mummified tissue
- Coprolites (fossilized feces)
- Dental remains
- Ancient DNA (aDNA)

**Goals:**
- Understand health of past populations
- Disease evolution
- Epidemiological transitions
- Impact of agriculture, urbanization
- Violence and trauma
- Nutrition and stress

---

## Limitations

### What Bones Can't Tell

**Only Some Diseases Affect Bones:**
- Chronic conditions (time to remodel)
- Severe acute (death before remodeling)
- Many diseases leave no skeletal evidence

**Examples NOT Visible:**
- Heart disease
- Most cancers
- Viral infections (usually)
- Soft tissue injuries
- Acute infections (death too fast)

**Osteological Paradox:**
- Healthiest individuals may have no lesions (died quickly)
- Sickest show pathology (survived, bones responded)
- Interpretation complex

**Jane Buikstra & Della Cook:**
- "Paleopathology: An American Account" (1980)
- Founders of modern paleopathology

## Infectious Disease

### Reading Infections from Bones

**Periostitis:**
- Inflammation of periosteum (bone surface)
- New bone formation (woven bone)
- Appears as roughening, pitting
- Non-specific (many causes)

**Osteomyelitis:**
- Bone infection
- Abscess, drainage (cloacae)
- Destruction and formation
- Chronic

**Specific Infections:**

### Tuberculosis (TB)

**Skeletal Involvement:**
- ~5% of TB cases
- Spine (Pott's disease)
- Collapse of vertebrae
- Kyphosis (hunchback)
- Hip, knee joints

**History:**
- Ancient (evidence from Neolithic)
- Increased with domestication (cattle)
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis (human)
- Mycobacterium bovis (cattle)

**Urban Life:**
- Crowding spreads TB
- Industrial cities

**aDNA:**
- Confirm diagnosis
- Track strains

### Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)

**Skeletal Changes:**
- Face (nasal resorption)
- Hands, feet (bone resorption)
- Rhinomaxillary syndrome

**History:**
- Medieval Europe
- Leprosy hospitals (leper colonies)
- Stigma

**Mycobacterium leprae:**
- Related to TB
- Less infectious

### Syphilis

**Treponematoses:**
- Syphilis (venereal)
- Yaws (tropical, non-venereal)
- Bejel (endemic syphilis)
- Same bacterium (Treponema pallidum), different strains

**Skeletal Changes:**
- Periostitis (tibiae = "saber shin")
- Skull (caries sicca)
- Gummatous lesions (destruction)

**Debate:**
- Pre-Columbian in Old World?
- Or: brought from Americas (Columbus)?
- Evidence both sides
- Yaws ancient, syphilis evolved?

**Bruce Rothschild:**
- Treponematosis expert
- Differentiation difficult

## Degenerative Disease

### Arthritis

**Osteoarthritis (OA):**
- "Wear and tear"
- Joint degeneration
- Cartilage loss
- Eburnation (polishing)

**Causes:**
- Age
- Mechanical stress
- Occupational

## Dental Pathology

### Teeth Tell Stories

**Caries (Cavities):**
- Bacterial (Streptococcus mutans)

**Periodontal Disease:**
- Gum disease
- Bone loss (alveolar)
- Tooth loss

**Dental Wear:**
- Attrition (tooth-to-tooth)
- Abrasion (external, grit in food)
- Erosion (chemical)

**Patterns:**
- Heavy wear: coarse diet, grit
- Flat wear: grinding stones
- Grooves: tool use (teeth as tools)

**Enamel Hypoplasia:**

- Natron (drying)
- Wrapped

**Computed Tomography (CT):**
- "Virtual autopsy"
- Non-destructive
- 3D imaging
- Can "unwrap" digitally

## Epidemiological Transitions

### Health Over Time

**Armelagos & Cohen:**
- "Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture" (1984)

**Transition 1: Neolithic (Agriculture):**
- Sedentism, farming
- Population growth
- **Health declined:**
  - More infectious disease (crowding, animals)
  - More caries (carbs)
  - Nutritional deficiencies (less diverse diet)
  - Shorter stature
  - Increased anemia

**Paradox:**
- Agriculture = more food
- But: poorer health
- Reliance on few crops (risk)

**Transition 2: Industrial (19th-20th C):**
- Infectious disease still major
- Urban crowding
- Pollution
- Eventually: sanitation, medicine improve

**Transition 3: Modern:**
- Chronic disease (heart, cancer)
- Obesity
- Lifestyle
- Longer lifespans

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Did agriculture make us sicker or healthier?

**Question 2:** Can we diagnose ancient diseases with certainty?

**Question 3:** How much violence was there in the past?

**Question 4:** What can enamel hypoplasia tell us about childhood stress?

**Question 5:** Should we CT-scan mummies (destructive vs. knowledge)?

**Remember:** Paleopathology studies ancient disease from skeletal remains (bones, mummies, teeth, aDNA). Limitations: only some diseases affect bones, osteological paradox (sickest survived long enough to show pathology). Infectious disease: periostitis non-specific, TB (Pott's disease spine collapse), leprosy (facial/hand/foot resorption), syphilis/treponematoses (saber shin). Arthritis: OA "wear and tear" (eburnation, osteophytes), patterns infer activities. Metabolic disease: rickets/osteomalacia (vitamin D deficiency, industrial epidemic), anemia (porotic hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia). Dental: caries rare in hunter-gatherers, increased with agriculture (maize), enamel hypoplasia (childhood stress permanent record). Trauma: blunt/sharp/projectile force, warfare (Crow Creek massacre, Kennewick Man, Ötzi murdered), interpersonal violence, occupational markers (MSM, archery). Trepanation ancient surgery (50%+ survived). Cancer rare (age-related, soft tissue). Mummies preserve soft tissue (Ötzi, bog bodies, Egyptian), CT virtual autopsy. Epidemiological transitions: agriculture declined health (more disease, caries, anemia, shorter stature)—Armelagos & Cohen paradox. Understanding paleopathology reveals how anthropologists reconstruct ancient health, disease, violence, daily life from bones—past was often harsh.
