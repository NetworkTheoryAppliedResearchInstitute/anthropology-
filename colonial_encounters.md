# Colonial Encounters: Early Anthropology's Context (1860-1920)

---

## The Imperial Stage

When anthropology emerged as a formal discipline (1860s-1920s), the world was deeply divided:

**European colonial powers controlled:**
- Britain: India, large parts of Africa, Australia, Caribbean, Pacific islands
- France: North and West Africa, Indochina, Pacific
- Belgium: Congo (under brutal personal rule of King Leopold)
- Netherlands: Indonesia (Dutch East Indies)
- Germany: Parts of Africa and Pacific (until WWI)
- Spain and Portugal: Declining but still holding American and African territories
- United States: Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii (emerging imperial power)

**The colonized:**
- Indigenous peoples of Americas
- African societies under European rule
- Asian societies under various degrees of colonial control
- Pacific island peoples
- Aboriginal Australians

This wasn't just political and economic domination—it was a total system requiring **intellectual justification**. Anthropology provided that justification, even when some anthropologists opposed colonial practices.

## How Colonial Power Shaped Anthropology

### 1. Access to "Subjects"

Colonial control gave anthropologists access to people they studied:

> **British Anthropologists in Africa:**
>
> E.E. Evans-Pritchard studied the Nuer and Azande because Britain ruled Sudan. He relied on:
> - Colonial administration for permits
> - Government reports for background
> - Colonial infrastructure for travel
> - Protection of colonial military
> - Relationship with colonial officials
>
> Without colonialism, this research would have been impossible—or at least fundamentally different.

> **American Anthropologists and Native Americans:**
>
> Franz Boas could study Kwakwaka'wakw because:
> - U.S. and Canada had confined indigenous peoples to reservations
> - Indigenous peoples had limited ability to refuse
- Government wanted ethnographic information
> - Boas could move freely in territory now controlled by settlers
>
> The power differential shaped every research relationship.

### 2. Funding and Institutional Support

**Who paid for anthropology?**

**Colonial Governments:**
- Wanted information about colonized peoples for better governance
- Funded surveys and studies
- Employed anthropologists as advisors

**Museums:**
- Competed for exotic objects
- Sent expeditions to collect artifacts (often without consent)
- Displayed "primitive" peoples and objects

**Universities:**
- Often funded by colonial wealth (merchants, plantation owners)
- Trained colonial administrators
- Anthropology departments served imperial education

**Missionary Societies:**
- Documented "pagan" practices to better convert people
- Provided some ethnographic information (often filtered through missionary bias)

> **The Scramble for Objects:**
>
> The late 19th century saw frenzied collection of indigenous objects:
> - British Museum
> - Berlin Museum
> - American Museum of Natural History
> - Smithsonian
> - Many others
>
> These institutions sent expeditions to collect objects, often:
> - Buying sacred items from people who didn't understand they were selling something sacred
> - Taking objects without consent
> - Looting graves and sacred sites
> - Using colonial power to compel "sales"
>
> **Today:** Many museums hold thousands of objects whose acquisition was ethically and legally problematic. Repatriation struggles continue.

### 3. The "Laboratory" Concept

Colonizers viewed colonized territories as **laboratories** for studying human diversity:

**The Logic:**
- "Primitive" peoples living there are like living fossils
- They show what Europeans once were like
- Study them to understand human evolution
- Before they "vanish" or become "contaminated" by civilization

**The Problem:**
This treated living people as specimens, not as contemporary humans with their own histories and futures.

> **Example: Reservation Anthropology**
>
> U.S. government confined Native Americans to reservations, creating:
> - Concentrated populations easy to study
> - Controlled environments
> - Captive subjects
>
> Anthropologists could arrive, gather data, and leave. Native peoples had limited ability to refuse or control how they were represented.

## Theoretical Schools and Colonial Context

### Evolutionism: Scientific Justification for Empire

**How Evolutionism Served Colonialism:**

**1. Ranking Justified Domination:**
If Europeans were "civilized" and colonized peoples were "savages" or "barbarians," colonial rule seemed natural and even beneficial.

**2. "Civilizing Mission":**
Colonialism could be framed as helping lower societies evolve upward:
- Education in Western ways
- Christian conversion (from "primitive" religion)
- Economic development (from "subsistence" to "modern" economy)
- Political tutelage (preparing for self-governance "when ready")

**3. Taking Resources Seemed Reasonable:**
If "primitives" weren't using land "productively" (i.e., not farming it European-style), taking it seemed justified.

**4. Destroying Cultures Seemed Progressive:**
Banning "savage" practices (ceremonies, dances, traditional governance) seemed like helping societies evolve.

> **Example: Australian "Protection" Policies**
>
> Based on evolutionary thinking, Australian authorities:
> - Removed Aboriginal children from families ("for their own good")
> - Banned traditional practices as "primitive"
> - Confined people to missions and reserves
> - Tried to "breed out" Aboriginal identity
> - Justified all this as helping Aborigines "advance" toward civilization
>
> **Result:** Stolen Generations—cultural genocide based partly on anthropological ranking.

### Diffusionism: Sometimes Better, Sometimes Worse

**Moderate Diffusionism:**
- Recognized all cultures could innovate and borrow
- Less inherently racist than evolutionism
- But still could assume colonized peoples only borrowed, never invented

**Extreme Diffusionism (British school):**
- Egypt hypothesis assumed only one civilization could create
- Other "primitives" just poorly copied
- Actually MORE racist in some ways

### Boas: Anti-Colonial in Principle, Complicit in Practice

**Boas's Anti-Colonial Positions:**

**Fought racism:**
- Argued colonized peoples were mentally equal to Europeans
- Opposed scientific racism
- Supported indigenous rights (to some degree)

**Critiqued colonial anthropology:**
- Rejected ranking of cultures
- Opposed anthropologists working for colonial governments
- Spoke against imperialism

**But Still Benefited from Colonial System:**

**Access:**
- Could study indigenous peoples because of colonial infrastructure
- Traveled freely in colonized territories
- Sometimes used colonial connections

**Extraction:**
- Took knowledge and objects back to museums
- Advanced his career using indigenous knowledge
- Communities didn't control how they were represented

**Salvage Ethnography:**
- Urgency to "record before they vanish" didn't question WHY they were vanishing (colonial destruction)
- Documented cultures while colonialism destroyed them, without always fighting the destruction

> **The Tension:**
>
> Boas genuinely cared about indigenous peoples and opposed their mistreatment. But he also built a career on studying them, took their knowledge to enrich Western institutions, and didn't fundamentally challenge the colonial system that enabled his work.
>
> This tension—good intentions within a bad system—characterized much early anthropology.

## Colonial Anthropology in Different Regions

### British Africa: Applied Anthropology for "Indirect Rule"

**The System:**
- Britain wanted to govern colonies cheaply
- "Indirect rule" governed through existing "tribal" structures
- Needed to understand local systems

**Anthropologists' Role:**
- Studied kinship, political organization, land tenure
- Advised colonial officers
- Helped design policies
- Trained administrators

**Key Figures:**
- Bronislaw Malinowski
- E.E. Evans-Pritchard
- Meyer Fortes
- Max Gluckman

**The Problem:**
- Anthropological knowledge helped control colonized peoples
- "Tribal" categories froze and simplified complex realities
- Research funded by and served colonial interests

> **Example: "Tribal" Identities**
>
> Colonial authorities, with anthropological help, created rigid "tribal" categories:
> - Mapped "tribal territories"
> - Appointed "tribal chiefs" (sometimes inventing positions that didn't exist)
> - Administered through "native law and custom" (as anthropologists described it)
>
> **Result:** "Tribes" that seemed ancient and timeless were often colonial creations or severe simplifications. These identities later fueled post-colonial conflicts.

### American Anthropology and Native Americans

**The Context:**
- U.S. confined Native Americans to reservations
- Federal Indian policy shifted from removal to assimilation
- Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) had total control over Native lives

**Anthropologists' Role:**
- Documented languages and cultures under government contracts
- Collected artifacts for museums
- Provided information used in land claims (sometimes helping, sometimes harming tribes)
- Some advocated for Native rights; others served government interests

**The Contradictions:**

**Boas and students:**
- Genuinely wanted to preserve Native knowledge
- Opposed worst government policies
- BUT took knowledge away to museums and universities
- Didn't fundamentally challenge dispossession

**BIA Anthropologists:**
- Some tried to make policy more culturally sensitive
- Others helped enforce assimilation
- Applied anthropology served government, not tribes

> **Example: Boarding Schools**
>
> Anthropologists documented Native languages and cultures while:
> - Government forcibly removed children to boarding schools
> - Schools banned Native languages (those same languages anthropologists documented)
> - Punishment for speaking indigenous languages
> - "Kill the Indian, save the man"
>
> **The Irony:** Anthropologists preserved languages in archives while government destroyed them in practice.

### French Colonial Anthropology

**Less Applied Than British:**
- More theoretical, philosophical orientation
- Less directly involved in colonial administration
- But still embedded in colonial context

**Access Through Empire:**
- Studied colonized peoples in French Africa, Indochina
- Used colonial infrastructure
- Benefited from French control

**Later:**
- Structuralism (Lévi-Strauss) emerged from colonial encounters
- Critiqued Western thought but didn't always challenge colonialism directly

### Pacific and Australia: Particularly Brutal

**Australian Anthropology:**
- Studied Aboriginal peoples during active displacement and violence
- "Smoothing the dying pillow" mentality—document "vanishing" races
- Collected skulls and bodies (grave robbing common)
- Minimal opposition to genocidal policies

**Pacific Anthropology:**
- German, British, French, American interests competing
- Islanders under various colonial controls
- Anthropologists dependent on colonial infrastructure and protection

## The Human Cost: What Colonial Anthropology Enabled

### Knowledge Used Against People Studied

**Land Dispossession:**
- Anthropological testimony in court cases sometimes supported taking indigenous lands
- "They don't use it properly" (based on anthropological description of subsistence practices)

**Cultural Destruction:**
- Ethnographies documented practices that governments then banned
- Information about sacred sites led to desecration
- Knowledge of political organization used to destroy it

**Forced Assimilation:**
- Anthropological ideas about "primitives" justified removing children, banning languages, destroying religions

### The Spectacle of Colonized Peoples

**World's Fairs and Expositions:**
- Chicago (1893), St. Louis (1904), Brussels (1897), and many others
- Featured "ethnological villages" where colonized peoples were displayed
- Anthropologists often involved in organizing these
- Treated humans as specimens for entertainment

> **Philippine Reservation at St. Louis World's Fair (1904):**
>
> U.S. displayed 1,200 Filipinos in a 47-acre "reservation":
> - Different ethnic groups in "native villages"
> - Igorot people particularly featured as "savage headhunters"
> - People performed daily activities for spectators
> - Presented as justification for U.S. colonization of Philippines
> - Anthropologists W.J. McGee and others involved in organization
>
> **The Message:** Filipinos need American civilization; colonialism is beneficial.

**Museum Displays:**
- Indigenous objects taken and displayed
- Human remains exhibited
- "Primitive" peoples contrasted with "civilized" Europeans
- Reinforced racial hierarchies

## Resistance and Limits

### Indigenous Agency: Not Just Passive Subjects

Despite colonial power, indigenous peoples:
- Sometimes refused anthropologists
- Controlled what information they shared
- Used anthropology for their own purposes
- Challenged anthropological representations

> **Example: Zuni Control of Knowledge**
>
> Zuni people in New Mexico:
> - Selectively shared some knowledge with anthropologists
> - Kept sacred knowledge secret
> - Later created Zuni Cultural Resource Enterprise to control research
> - Demonstrated indigenous peoples weren't passive objects

### Some Anthropologists Challenged Colonialism

**Franz Boas:**
- Opposed racism publicly
- Testified against immigration restrictions
- Supported some indigenous rights

**Alice Cunningham Fletcher:**
- Advocated for Native American rights
- Though also participated in problematic allotment policies

**Later Activists:**
- Some anthropologists became advocates
- But institutional pressures limited how far they could go

**The Limits:**
Even well-intentioned anthropologists operated within and benefited from colonial systems. Individual good intentions couldn't undo structural problems.

## The Reckoning: Understanding This History

### Why It Matters Today

**1. Colonial Legacies Persist:**
- Museums still hold colonial collections
- Anthropological categories still shape policy
- Research relationships still often extractive
- Western institutions still control knowledge

**2. Decolonizing Anthropology Requires Historical Understanding:**
- Can't fix problems without understanding their origins
- Contemporary critiques build on this history
- Indigenous scholars cite this history in demanding change

**3. It Shapes Contemporary Ethics:**
- IRB (Institutional Review Board) requirements
- NAGPRA (repatriation law)
- Collaborative research models
- Community control over research

### The Difficult Truth

**Anthropology wasn't separate from colonialism—it was part of the colonial system:**

- **Institutionally:** Funded by, dependent on, serving colonial powers
- **Intellectually:** Theories often justified colonial hierarchies
- **Practically:** Knowledge used to control colonized peoples
- **Ethically:** Extraction without consent or benefit

**Even anti-colonial anthropologists (like Boas) were compromised by this system.**

This doesn't mean all early anthropology was worthless or evil. It means:
- Knowledge produced is tainted by the conditions of its production
- Good intentions don't erase structural problems
- Contemporary anthropology must reckon with this history
- Decolonization requires fundamental transformation, not just good intentions

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Could anthropology have developed without colonialism, or was colonialism necessary for the discipline's emergence?

**Question 2:** Can knowledge gathered under colonial conditions ever be "cleansed" or should it be rejected entirely?

**Question 3:** Were anthropologists like Boas complicit in colonialism even though they opposed it? Can you benefit from a system while critiquing it?

**Question 4:** How do we use historical anthropological knowledge (like linguistic documentation or cultural descriptions) without perpetuating colonial patterns?

**Question 5:** What would genuinely decolonized anthropology look like? Is it even possible within current institutional structures?

**Remember:** This history isn't just about the past. Colonial patterns persist in anthropology today: Western institutions controlling knowledge about non-Western peoples, extraction of data without adequate community benefit, career advancement built on others' knowledge. Acknowledging this history is the first step toward transformation. But acknowledgment isn't enough—fundamental change is needed in who does anthropology, how it's done, who benefits, and who controls anthropological knowledge.
