# Performance and Narrative: Enacting and Telling Meaning

---

## Performance as Cultural Practice

**Performance:**
- Embodied action
- Communicates meaning
- Creates social reality
- Not just theater—everyday life

**Erving Goffman, "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life" (1959):**

**Life = Theater:**
- Social interaction = performance
- Front stage (public) vs. backstage (private)
- Impression management
- Roles, scripts

**Example: Waiter**
- Front stage: polite, efficient, smile
- Backstage: kitchen, complains, relaxes
- Performance maintains illusion

**Dramaturgical Model:**
- Setting, props, costume
- Team performances
- Audience
- Disruptions (embarrassment)

**Insight:**
- Social life = performed
- Authenticity = another performance
- Constant self-presentation

## Performance Theory in Anthropology

### Victor Turner: Social Drama

**Turner's Performance Theory:**
- Social life = drama
- Conflicts enacted
- Ritual = performance

**Social Drama (Four Phases):**

**1. Breach:**
- Norm violation
- Disruption

**2. Crisis:**
- Conflict escalates
- Takes sides

**3. Redressive Action:**
- Intervention (ritual, legal, etc.)
- Attempts to resolve

**4. Reintegration or Schism:**
- Restore harmony OR
- Split, new normal

**Example: Ndembu Conflict**
- Succession dispute
- Ritual performed
- Community healed (or not)

**Ritual as Performance:**
- Transformative
- Not just symbol—action
- Creates change

### Richard Schechner: Performance Studies

**Schechner (Theater Director + Anthropologist):**
- Blurred ritual and theater
- All performance on continuum

**Restored Behavior:**
- Performance = "twice-behaved behavior"
- Rehearsed, repeated
- Not spontaneous
- Ritual, theater, everyday

**Continuum:**
```
Ritual ←―――――――――→ Theater
Efficacy              Entertainment
```

**Not Absolute:**
- Ritual can entertain
- Theater can transform
- Both performative

**Liminoid:**
- Like liminality (Turner)
- But voluntary (art, leisure)
- Modern equivalent

## Dell Hymes: Ethnography of Communication

### SPEAKING Model

**Hymes (Linguistic Anthropology):**
- Language in context
- Performance = situated

**SPEAKING:**
- **S**etting (time, place)
- **P**articipants (speaker, audience)
- **E**nds (goals, outcomes)
- **A**ct sequence (message form)
- **K**ey (tone, manner)
- **I**nstrumentalities (channel, code)
- **N**orms (interaction, interpretation)
- **G**enre (type of speech event)

**Example: Sermon**
- Setting: church, Sunday
- Participants: preacher, congregation
- Ends: spiritual edification
- Act sequence: scripture, exegesis, application
- Key: solemn, authoritative
- Instrumentalities: spoken, religious register
- Norms: reverence, response (Amen)
- Genre: religious discourse

**Insight:**
- Context shapes meaning
- Performance = contextualized action

---

## Folklore and Oral Performance

### Ruth Finnegan: Oral Literature

**"Oral Literature in Africa" (1970):**

**Oral ≠ Simple:**
- Complex, sophisticated
- Poetry, epics, proverbs
- Performance art

**Not "Primitive":**
- Rich traditions
- Skilled performers
- Aesthetic criteria

**Features:**
- Formulaic (repetition, patterns)
- Participatory (audience responds)
- Variable (each performance unique)
- Embodied (voice, gesture, music)

### Epic Performance

> **Mande Epic (West Africa)**
>
> **Sunjata Epic:**
> - Founding of Mali Empire
> - Oral historians (griots/jeliw)
> - Hours of performance
> - Musical accompaniment (kora)
> - Praise, genealogy, history
>
> **Performance:**
> - Not memorized verbatim
> - Themes, formulas
> - Improvisation
> - Audience participation
>
> **Social Function:**
> - Legitimize power
> - Preserve history
> - Entertainment
> - Moral instruction

> **Homer (Ancient Greece)**
>
> - Iliad, Odyssey
> - Originally oral
> - Formulaic epithets ("wine-dark sea")
> - Performance tradition
> - Later written

### Albert Lord: "The Singer of Tales" (1960)

**Oral-Formulaic Theory:**
- Yugoslav epic singers
- Compose in performance
- Use formulas (stock phrases)
- Not memorization—recreation
- Each performance unique

**Implications:**
- Oral literature ≠ written
- Different aesthetics
- Performance central

## Narrative and Storytelling

### What Is Narrative?

**Story:**
- Sequence of events
- Characters, plot
- Beginning, middle, end
- Meaning-making through story

**Universal:**
- All cultures tell stories
- Essential to human meaning

**Functions:**
- Entertain
- Teach
- Preserve history
- Create identity
- Make sense of experience

### Jerome Bruner: Narrative Mode of Thought

**Two Modes:**

**1. Paradigmatic (Logico-Scientific):**
- Abstract, general
- Cause-effect
- Categories
- Science, logic

**2. Narrative:**
- Particular, specific
- Intentional actions
- Story
- Literature, everyday

**Both Essential:**
- Narrative creates meaning
- "Story self"
- Identity = narrative

**Life as Story:**
- We narrate our lives
- Coherence, meaning
- "Who am I?" = story

---

## Personal Narrative and Life History

### Charlotte Linde: Life Stories

**"Life Stories: The Creation of Coherence" (1993):**

**Life Story:**
- Not fixed
- Constantly revised
- Create coherent self
- Present self to others

**Coherence Principles:**
- Causality (this led to that)
- Continuity (same person)
- Thematic (meaningful patterns)

**Example:**
- Career change narrated as:
  - "Always interested in..."
  - Retrospective coherence
  - Creates continuity

**Anthropology:**
- Life histories = data
- But also: performance
- Identity work

### Examples

> **Oscar Lewis, "The Children of Sánchez" (1961)**
>
> **Mexican Family:**
> - Multiple voices
> - Same events, different stories
> - Reveals subjective experience
> - Controversial (criticized family)

> **Marjorie Shostak, "Nisa" (1981)**
>
> **!Kung Woman:**
> - Life history
> - Intimate portrait
> - Sexuality, marriage, motherhood
> - Cross-cultural collaboration
> - Critiques: representation, voice

> **Vincent Crapanzano, "Tuhami" (1980)**
>
> **Moroccan Man:**
> - Life history
> - Reflexive ethnography
> - Crapanzano's presence shapes story
> - Dialogical
> - Postmodern

## Myth as Narrative

### Functions of Myth (Revisited)

**Malinowski:**
- Charter for society
- Legitimize institutions

**Lévi-Strauss:**
- Resolve contradictions
- Structural logic

**But Also:**
- Entertainment
- Moral instruction
- Identity
- Cosmology

### Joseph Campbell: Monomyth

**"The Hero with a Thousand Faces" (1949):**

**Hero's Journey:**
- Universal story pattern
- Call to adventure
- Tests, trials
- Return transformed

**Stages:**
1. Departure (call, refusal, supernatural aid)
2. Initiation (road of trials, abyss, revelation)
3. Return (refusal, rescue, master of two worlds)

**Cross-Cultural:**
- Gilgamesh, Odysseus, Buddha, Jesus, etc.
- Similar structure

**Critique:**
- Universalizing
- Ignores difference
- Jungian psychology (archetypes)
- But: influential (Star Wars, etc.)

---

## Performance and Identity

### Judith Butler: Gender as Performance

**"Gender Trouble" (1990):**

**Gender = Performative:**
- Not essence
- Repeated acts
- "Doing" gender
- Creates illusion of substance

**No Doer Behind Deed:**
- Only doing
- Gender through performance
- Not expressing pre-existing self

**Drag:**
- Makes visible
- Parody reveals construction
- Subversive potential

**Implications:**
- All identity performed
- Not fixed
- Repetition, citation
- But constraints (norms)

**Anthropology:**
- Studies gendered performances
- Cross-cultural variation
- Third genders, fluidity

---

## Spectacle and Public Performance

### Clifford Geertz: Negara

**"Negara: The Theatre State in 19th Century Bali" (1980):**

**Balinese State:**
- Not bureaucracy
- Theater, ritual, spectacle
- Kingship = performance

**State Rituals:**
- Cremations (massive)
- Temple ceremonies
- Displays of wealth
- Hierarchy enacted

**Critique:**
- "Theater state" = power?
- Or just symbolic?
- Debate: ritual as power vs. power creates ritual

**Insight:**
- Performance constitutes authority
- Not just represents

### David Kertzer: "Ritual, Politics, and Power" (1988)

**Political Ritual:**
- States use ritual
- Create legitimacy
- Spectacle

**Examples:**
- Coronations
- Military parades
- National holidays
- Inaugurations

**Functions:**
- Dramatize power
- Create solidarity
- Naturalize hierarchy
- Emotional engagement

**Symbols Ambiguous:**
- Multiple interpretations
- Unite despite difference
- Powerful because vague

---

## Everyday Performance

### Michel de Certeau: "The Practice of Everyday Life" (1984)

**Tactics vs. Strategies:**

**Strategies:**
- Powerful (institutions)
- Control space
- Plan, organize

**Tactics:**
- Weak (individuals)
- Make do
- Improvise, poach
- Everyday resistance

**Everyday Performances:**
- Walking (make own paths)
- Shopping (choose, subvert)
- Reading (reinterpret)
- Creative agency

**Not Grand Resistance:**
- Small acts
- Cumulative
- "Making do"

---

## Storytelling and Power

### Who Gets to Tell?

**Representation:**
- Whose stories told?
- Whose voices heard?
- Power in narration

**Gayatri Spivak:**
- "Can the Subaltern Speak?"
- Marginalized voices mediated
- Representation problematic

**Anthropology's Dilemma:**
- Anthropologists tell others' stories
- Power imbalance
- Collaborative methods?

### Counter-Narratives

**Resistance:**
- Alternative stories
- Challenge dominant narratives
- Reclaim voice

**Examples:**

**Indigenous Storytelling:**
- Oral histories
- Counter colonial narratives
- Sovereignty claims

**Feminist Storytelling:**
- Herstory
- Personal is political
- Consciousness-raising

**Black Lives Matter:**
- Counter-narrative to policing
- "Say their names"
- Storytelling as activism

---

## Digital Performance and Narrative

### Social Media

**Curated Selves:**
- Instagram, TikTok, etc.
- Performance of identity
- Goffman on steroids
- Front stage amplified

**Influencers:**
- Professional performance
- Authenticity = brand
- Parasocial relationships

**Anthropology:**
- Digital ethnography
- Online performance
- Virtual identity

### Danah Boyd: "It's Complicated"

**Teen Social Media:**
- Not destroying social skills
- Performing identity
- Networked publics
- Context collapse (multiple audiences)

**Context Collapse:**
- Goffman: separate audiences
- Online: everyone sees
- Challenging
- Strategic performance

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are we always performing, or is there an "authentic" self?

**Question 2:** Can storytelling change reality, or just represent it?

**Question 3:** Whose stories get told in your culture, and whose are silenced?

**Question 4:** Is social media making us more performative, or revealing existing performance?

**Question 5:** What stories do you tell about yourself, and how do they shape you?

**Remember:** Performance isn't just theater—it's everyday social life (Goffman). Turner connected ritual to drama, showing social conflicts enacted. Hymes's SPEAKING model shows context shapes performance. Oral traditions are sophisticated performance art (griots, epics). Narratives create meaning—we story ourselves into being (Bruner, Linde). Myths are universal stories but culturally specific. Gender is performative (Butler)—doing, not being. Spectacles create political authority (Geertz's theater state). Everyday life involves tactical performances (de Certeau). Digital media intensifies performance (curated selves, context collapse). Understanding performance reveals how humans enact and narrate meaning—we are performing, storytelling animals creating ourselves and our worlds.
