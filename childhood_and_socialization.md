# Childhood and Socialization: Growing Up Across Cultures

---

## Childhood: Universal or Cultural?

### The Question

**Is Childhood Universal?**
- All societies have children
- But: "childhood" as concept varies
- Age categories differ
- Expectations differ
- Treatment differs

**Philippe Ariès, "Centuries of Childhood" (1960):**
- Medieval Europe: no separate childhood
- Children = small adults
- Modern childhood = recent invention
- Critique: overstated, but influential

**Anthropology:**
- Childhood culturally constructed
- Variable worldwide
- Age matters differently

---

## Socialization and Enculturation

### Key Concepts

**Socialization:**
- Process of becoming member of society
- Learn norms, values, roles
- Lifelong, not just childhood

**Enculturation:**
- Learn culture
- Become culturally competent
- Anthropological term

**Agents:**
- Family (primary)
- Peers
- School
- Media
- Religious institutions

## Child-Rearing Practices

### Margaret Mead: Samoa

**"Coming of Age in Samoa" (1928):**

**Claim:**
- Samoan adolescence stress-free
- No teenage rebellion
- Contrast: US
- Proves culture, not biology

**Why?**
- Permissive child-rearing
- Gradual transitions
- Extended family support
- Sexual freedom (pre-marriage)

**Controversy:**
- Derek Freeman attacked (1983)
- Said Mead wrong
- Informants lied
- Samoa has stress

**Debate:**
- Still contested
- But: Mead's point stands
- Adolescence culturally variable

### Attachment and Infant Care

**Western (Bowlby):**
- Mother-infant bond crucial
- Attachment theory
- Separation anxiety
- Nuclear family model

**Cross-Cultural Variation:**

> **!Kung (Kalahari)**
>
> **Melvin Konner:**
> - Constant contact (skin-to-skin)
> - Carried always
> - Nurse on demand (4+ years)
> - Multiple caregivers
> - Secure attachment, different path

> **Japanese**
>
> **Takeo Doi:**
> - Amae (indulgent dependency)
> - Close mother-child bond
> - Sleep together (co-sleeping)
> - Interdependence valued
> - Not "spoiled" but cultural

> **Gusii (Kenya)**
>
> **Robert LeVine:**
> - Infant mortality high historically
> - Focus: physical survival
> - Less verbal interaction

**Question 4:** Do children have agency, or are they shaped entirely by adults?

**Question 5:** How does poverty shape childhood experiences?

**Remember:** Childhood is culturally constructed—universal life stage but meanings, practices vary enormously. Mead showed Samoan adolescence differs from US. Attachment and infant care vary (!Kung constant contact, Japanese co-sleeping, Gusii focus on survival). Independence vs. interdependence as cultural goals. Play universal but culturally shaped. Children work in many societies (not always exploitation). Sibling caretaking common globally. Language socialization teaches culture through talk (Ochs, Schieffelin). Emotions learned. Gender socialized from birth. Children have agency (not passive). Poverty structures childhood (Scheper-Hughes). Street children, child soldiers show resilience amid violence. Children's rights debates universal vs. cultural. Understanding childhood anthropology reveals how societies shape human development—and how childhood is always cultural, historical, political.
