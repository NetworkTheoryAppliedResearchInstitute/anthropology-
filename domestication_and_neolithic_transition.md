# Domestication and the Neolithic Transition: The Agricultural Revolution

---

## What Is the Neolithic Revolution?

### From Foraging to Farming

**Definition:**
- Transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture
- Domestication of plants and animals
- Sedentism (settling down)
- "Neolithic" = New Stone Age

**V. Gordon Childe (1920s):**
- Coined term "Neolithic Revolution"
- Compared to Industrial Revolution
- Fundamental transformation

**When:**
- ~10,000 BCE onwards
- **NOT simultaneous worldwide**
- Independent origins (multiple centers)

**Where:**
- At least 7-10 independent centers
- Diffusion from centers

---

## What Is Domestication?

### Genetic Change Through Selection

**Definition:**
- Human selection of plants/animals
- Genetic changes over generations
- Morphological differences from wild ancestors
- Behavioral changes (animals)
- Dependency (can't survive without humans, some)

**Process:**
- Intentional or unintentional
- Probably both
- Unconscious selection (initial)
- Conscious breeding (later)

**Not Instantaneous:**
- Gradual (centuries, millennia)
- Archaeological challenge (when fully domesticated?)

---

## Plant Domestication

### Morphological Changes

**Seeds:**
- Larger
- Non-shattering (don't disperse)
- Wild: shatters (spreads seeds)
- Domesticated: stays on plant (easier harvest)
- **But:** can't reproduce without human planting

**Loss of Dormancy:**
- Wild seeds: delayed germination (hedge bets)
- Domesticated: germinate together (predictable)

**Loss of Defenses:**
- Wild: thorns, toxins, bitter taste
- Domesticated: reduced (selection for palatability)

**Dependence:**
- Many crops can't survive without humans
- Maize (corn): naked kernels, tight husk

---

## Animal Domestication

### Behavioral and Physical Changes

**Behavioral:**
- Docility (less aggressive, less fearful)
- Accept human control
- Breed in captivity

**Physical (Domestication Syndrome):**
- Smaller brain
- Juvenile features (neoteny)
- Floppy ears, curly tails
- Coat color variation (piebald)
- Shorter snouts

**Why?**
- Selection for tameness
- Genes affecting behavior also affect morphology
- Russian fox experiment (Dmitry Belyaev)
  - Selected for tameness alone
  - Physical changes appeared (unintentionally)

**Challenges:**
- Not all animals domesticable
- Jared Diamond: "Anna Karenina Principle"
  - Must satisfy many criteria
  - One failure = no domestication

**Criteria:**
- Diet (not too expensive to feed)
- Growth rate (mature reasonably fast)
- Breeding in captivity
- Disposition (not too aggressive)
- Social hierarchy (follow leaders)
- Don't panic (flight response manageable)

**Result:**
- Only ~14 large mammals domesticated
- Most in Eurasia

## Independent Centers of Domestication

### Multiple Inventions

**At Least 7-10 Centers:**

### 1. Fertile Crescent (Southwest Asia, ~10,000 BCE)

**Location:**
- Modern Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Iran

**Plants:**
- **Cereals:** Wheat (einkorn, emmer), barley
- **Legumes:** Lentils, peas, chickpeas
- **Other:** Flax (linen, oil)

**Animals:**
- Sheep, goats (~8,500 BCE)
- Cattle (~8,000 BCE)
- Pigs (~8,000 BCE)

**Sites:**
- Jericho (pre-pottery Neolithic, early sedentism)
- Göbekli Tepe (ritual site, pre-agriculture?)
- Çatalhöyük (large Neolithic town, ~7,500 BCE)

**"Founder Crops":**
- Package spread together (Europe, North Africa)

### 2. China (~9,000 BCE)

**Two Regions:**

**North China (Yellow River):**
- Millet (foxtail, broomcorn)
- Pigs, chickens

**South China (Yangtze River):**
- Rice (~8,000 BCE)
- Water buffalo

**Later:**
- Soybeans

### 3. Mesoamerica (~8,000-5,000 BCE)

**Plants:**
- **Maize (corn):** From teosinte (wild grass)
  - Dramatic transformation
  - Richard MacNeish (Tehuacán Valley)
  - Slow domestication process
- Beans, squash ("Three Sisters")
- Avocados, chili peppers, cacao

**Animals:**
- Dogs
- Turkeys
- **No large mammals** (megafauna extinct)

**Consequence:**
- No plows (no draft animals)
- No transport (no horses until Europeans)

### 4. Andean South America and Amazonia (~8,000-5,000 BCE)

**Highlands (Andes):**
- Potatoes, quinoa
- Llamas, alpacas (only large domesticates in Americas)
- Guinea pigs

**Lowlands (Amazonia):**
- Manioc (cassava)
- Sweet potato
- Peanuts

### 5. Sub-Saharan Africa (~5,000-3,000 BCE)

**Sahel:**
- Sorghum, pearl millet
- African rice (Oryza glaberrima, independent from Asian rice)

**West Africa:**
- Yams, oil palm

**Ethiopia:**
- Teff, coffee

**Animals:**
- Cattle (local domestication or from Near East?)
- Donkeys (North Africa)
- Guinea fowl

### 6. North America Eastern Woodlands (~4,000-3,000 BCE)

**Plants:**
- Sunflower, squash (local varieties)
- Goosefoot, marsh elder
- Sumpweed

**Abandoned:**
- Later replaced by maize (from Mesoamerica)

### 7. New Guinea (~7,000 BCE)

**Plants:**
- Taro, yams, bananas, sugarcane

**Animals:**
- Pigs (from Southeast Asia)

## The Process: How Did It Happen?

### Theories

**Intentional:**
- Deliberate planting
- Recognize cause-effect

**Unintentional:**
- Seeds in trash heaps germinate
- Protection of useful plants
- "Dump heap" theory

**Gradual:**
- Low-level food production
- Supplement foraging
- Intensify over time

**Coevolution:**
- Humans and plants/animals
- Mutual dependency

---

## Why Agriculture?

### Push or Pull?

**Long Debated:**

### Population Pressure (Ester Boserup)

- Population growth
- Foraging insufficient
- Intensify (agriculture)
- **Push:** forced by necessity

### Climate Change

- End of Pleistocene (Ice Age)
- Warming, stabilization (~11,700 years ago)
- Holocene climate favorable
- Wild cereals abundant (Fertile Crescent)
- Sedentism possible
- Population grows
- Then: Younger Dryas (cold snap, 10,800-9,700 BCE)
- Stress → agriculture

**Brian Hayden:**
- Feasting, competition
- Agriculture for surplus
- Prestige
- **Pull:** social motivations

**Multivariate:**
- Climate, population, social
- Different in each center

---

## Consequences of Agriculture

### The Neolithic Package

**Material Culture:**
- Pottery (storage, cooking)
- Grinding stones (process grain)
- Sickles (harvest)
- Polished stone tools (axes, adzes)
- Permanent houses

**Sedentism:**
- Villages, towns
- Accumulation of possessions
- Storage facilities

**Population Growth:**
- Agriculture supports more people
- Sedentism enables shorter birth intervals
- More hands for farming

**But NOT Always Better:**

## The "Neolithic Paradox"

### Agriculture = Poorer Health?

**Evidence:**
- Skeletal analysis (paleopathology)
- Agricultural populations:
  - Shorter stature
  - More dental caries
  - Anemia (iron deficiency)
  - Nutritional stress (enamel hypoplasia)
  - Infectious disease (crowding, zoonoses)
  - Arthritis (repetitive labor)

**Mark Cohen:**
- "The Food Crisis in Prehistory" (1977)
- Agriculture NOT chosen
- Forced by population pressure
- Poorer quality diet

**Jared Diamond:**
- "Worst Mistake in Human History" (1987)
- Provocative

**Why Worse?**
- Reliance on few crops (nutritional deficiency)
- Crop failures (famine)
- Work harder (more labor than foraging)
- Diseases (zoonoses from animals, crowding)
- Inequality (surpluses allow elites)

**Then Why Do It?**
- Supports more people (total)
- Can't go back (population too large)
- "Trap"

---

## Social Consequences

### Inequality Emerges

**Hunter-Gatherers:**
- Generally egalitarian
- Sharing norms
- Mobility (hard to accumulate)

**Agriculturalists:**
- Surpluses accumulate
- Storage (wealth)
- Ownership (land)
- Inheritance
- **Inequality develops**

**Gender:**
- Farming = more work for women?
- Grinding grain, childcare (more children)
- Some argue gender inequality worsens

**Warfare:**
- Resource competition (land)
- Defense of crops, storage
- Fortifications appear

---

## Spread of Agriculture

### Diffusion vs. Migration

**Two Processes:**

**Demic Diffusion:**
- Farmers migrate
- Expand into new territories
- Displace or absorb foragers
- Population replacement

**Cultural Diffusion:**
- Ideas spread
- Local adoption
- Foragers become farmers
- Population continuity

**Europe:**
- Farming spreads from Near East (~6,500 BCE onwards)
- **Ancient DNA reveals:**
  - Demic diffusion (Anatolian farmers migrate)
  - Mix with local hunter-gatherers
  - Later: Steppe pastoralists (Bronze Age)

**Farming Spreads Faster Than Expected:**
- ~1 km/year average (Europe)
- Advantages (supports more people)
- Pushes foragers to margins

---

## Secondary Products Revolution

### Not Just Food

**Andrew Sherratt (1980s):**
- "Secondary Products Revolution"
- ~4,000 BCE

**Primary:**
- Meat (kill animals)

**Secondary:**
- Milk (dairy)
- Wool (shearing sheep)
- Traction (plow, transport)
- Manure (fertilizer)

**Implications:**
- Animals more valuable alive
- Sustained use
- Wealth (herds)
- Mobility (pastoralism)

---

## Pastoralism

### Specialized Herding

**Definition:**
- Reliance on domesticated animals
- Mobile (follow pastures)
- Nomadic or semi-nomadic

**Regions:**
- Steppes (Central Asia)
- Arid zones (Middle East, Africa)

**Animals:**
- Horses, cattle, sheep, goats, camels, yaks, reindeer

**Advantages:**
- Exploit marginal lands (unsuitable for farming)
- Mobility
- Flexibility

**Interaction with Farmers:**
- Trade (animals, animal products ↔ grain)
- Conflict (raids)
- Symbiosis (often)

---

## Göbekli Tepe: Complicating the Story

### Ritual Before Agriculture?

**Location:**
- Southeast Turkey
- Klaus Schmidt (excavator, 1990s-2010s)

**Age:**
- ~9,600-8,200 BCE
- Pre-Pottery Neolithic A

**Features:**
- Massive stone pillars (T-shaped)
- Carved animals (lions, snakes, scorpions)
- Circular enclosures
- Ritual center (no domestic structures)

**Surprise:**
- Hunter-gatherers (no agriculture yet)
- Monumental architecture
- Organized labor (hundreds of people)

**Implications:**
- Challenges assumption: agriculture → sedentism → surplus → monumental architecture
- **Maybe:** ritual centers → aggregation → resource pressure → agriculture
- Religion before farming?

**Debated:**
- Exact sequence unclear
- Some domesticated plants/animals nearby (contemporary?)

---

## Çatalhöyük: A Neolithic Town

### Early Urbanism?

**Location:**
- Central Turkey

**Age:**
- ~7,500-5,700 BCE

**Size:**
- 13 hectares
- 3,500-8,000 people (estimates)

**Features:**
- Dense settlement
- Houses built together (no streets)
- Enter through roof
- Murals (bulls, leopards, vultures, geometric)
- Plastered skulls (ancestor veneration?)
- Burial under floors

**Economy:**
- Agriculture (wheat, barley)
- Herding (sheep, goats)
- Hunting still important (aurochs)

**Ian Hodder:**
- Excavator (1990s-present)
- Post-processual approach
- Symbolism, ritual

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Was agriculture a mistake?

**Question 2:** Why did some societies adopt agriculture and others didn't?

**Question 3:** Did agriculture cause inequality, or enable it?

**Question 4:** Was Göbekli Tepe built by hunter-gatherers, or early farmers?

**Question 5:** Could humans return to foraging today?
