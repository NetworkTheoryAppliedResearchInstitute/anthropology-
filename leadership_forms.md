# Leadership Forms: Power, Authority, and Legitimacy

---

## What Makes a Leader?

**Universal questions:**
- Why do people follow?
- What gives leaders authority?
- How is power legitimized?
- What distinguishes leader from tyrant?

**Anthropology reveals:** Leadership takes radically different forms across societies.

**Key Distinction (Weber):**
- **Power:** Ability to impose will despite resistance
- **Authority:** Legitimate power (people consent/accept)

**This file explores:** Different forms of leadership and how authority is constructed and maintained.

## Max Weber: Three Types of Authority

### 1. Traditional Authority

**Based on:** Custom, precedent, "always been this way"

**Characteristics:**
- Hereditary typically
- Sanctioned by tradition
- Rules through established norms
- Personal loyalty to person, not office
- Patriarchal model

**Examples:**
- Monarchs ("divine right")
- Chiefs (hereditary)
- Elders (customary respect)
- Feudal lords

**Legitimacy Derives From:**
- Antiquity (ancient lineage)
- Sacred character
- Fulfilling traditional role

**Limits:**
- Must respect tradition (can't innovate arbitrarily)
- Genealogical legitimacy required
- Can be overthrown if violates norms

> **Example: Polynesian Chiefs**
>
> - Hereditary (primogeniture)
> - Divine descent (mana from gods)
> - Traditional protocols
> - Genealogies recited to prove legitimacy
> - But if lose mana (drought, defeat), can be replaced

### 2. Charismatic Authority

**Based on:** Extraordinary personal qualities

**Characteristics:**
- Personal magnetism, vision
- Perceived supernatural/exceptional gifts
- Revolutionary (breaks with tradition)
- Intense devotion from followers
- Unstable (tied to individual)

**Examples:**
- Prophets
- Revolutionary leaders
- Cult leaders
- Messiah figures

**Legitimacy Derives From:**
- Perceived special powers
- Miracles, visions, inspiration
- Crisis situations (traditional authority fails)

**Problem:**
- **Routinization of charisma** (Weber)
- Charismatic leader dies—now what?
- Must institutionalize or collapse
- Transform into traditional or rational-legal

> **Example: Ghost Dance (1890)**
>
> **Wovoka (Paiute Prophet):**
> - Vision of renewal
> - Ritual dance would bring back buffalo, ancestors
> - Repel white settlers
> - Spread rapidly among Plains Indians
> - Charismatic authority
> - Failed prophecy → collapsed

> **Example: Cargo Cults (Melanesia)**
>
> **Multiple Movements:**
> - Prophets promise cargo from ancestors/gods
> - Rituals to bring Western goods
> - Charismatic leaders
> - Colonial disruption creates context
> - Most fade when cargo doesn't arrive

### 3. Rational-Legal Authority

**Based on:** Impersonal rules and procedures

**Characteristics:**
- Authority vested in offices, not persons
- Bureaucratic organization
- Rules apply equally
- Meritocracy (ideally)
- Separation of office from person

**Examples:**
- Modern states
- Corporations
- Bureaucracies

**Legitimacy Derives From:**
- Legal process (elected, appointed)
- Competence
- Following rules

**Weber's View:**
- Modern form
- "Iron cage" (bureaucratization)
- Efficient but dehumanizing

**Anthropological Critique:**
- Even "rational-legal" has traditional and charismatic elements
- Not purely impersonal
- Cultural variation

## Achieved vs. Ascribed Leadership

### Ascribed Leadership

**Status by Birth:**
- Hereditary chiefs, kings
- Caste-based
- Gender, age (elders)
- Can't be changed

**Advantages:**
- Clear succession
- Stability
- Legitimacy from tradition

**Disadvantages:**
- Incompetent leaders inherit power
- No meritocracy
- Limited mobility

**Examples:**
- European monarchies
- Polynesian chieftainships
- Indian castes (hereditary occupations)

### Achieved Leadership

**Earned Status:**
- Big men (Melanesia)
- War leaders
- Anyone can rise
- Prove yourself

**Advantages:**
- Meritocracy
- Competent leaders
- Social mobility

**Disadvantages:**
- Instability
- Constant competition
- Succession crises

**Examples:**
- Melanesian big men
- Some Native American war chiefs
- Modern elected officials (ideally)

**Reality:** Most systems combine both (e.g., hereditary office but must prove worthy).

## Big Man Leadership (Melanesia)

### Characteristics

**Achieved, Not Inherited:**
- Anyone can become big man
- Through personal qualities:
  - Oratory skills
  - Wealth accumulation
  - Generosity
  - Organizing ability
  - Warfare prowess
  - Persuasion

**Temporary:**
- Big man status not permanent
- Must constantly validate
- Can fall if fails
- Sons don't automatically inherit (though advantages)

**No Coercive Power:**
- Can't force obedience
- Persuade, cajole, shame
- Followers can leave
- "First among equals"

**Economic Basis:**
- Polygyny (multiple wives = labor)
- Accumulate pigs, shell wealth
- Organize exchanges (moka, tee)
- Give away to gain prestige

### How to Become a Big Man

**Marshall Sahlins's Analysis:**

**1. Build Wealth:**
- Extra wives (more producers)
- Trade advantageously
- Accumulate pigs, shells
- Create exchange networks

**2. Cultivate Followers:**
- Loans, gifts to supporters
- Create obligations
- Persuasion, oratory
- Demonstrate generosity

**3. Organize Exchanges:**
- Moka, tee cycles
- Represent group
- Out-give rivals
- Validate status through massive giving

**4. Warfare Leadership:**
- Lead raids
- Protect group
- Gain prestige through bravery

**5. Maintain Position:**
- Constant work
- Can't rest on laurels
- Competitors emerge
- Must keep giving

**Anthropological Insight:**
- Leadership through achievement
- Egalitarian ethos (anyone can try)
- But competitive, hierarchical in practice
- "Egalitarian ideology, stratified reality"

> **Example: Kapauku Tonowi**
>
> **Leopold Pospisil:**
> - Tonowi (rich man/big man)
> - Accumulates through trade
> - Lends at interest
> - Generosity expected
> - Multiple tonowi compete
> - No single authority
> - Village political economy

> **Example: Moka Big Men**
>
> **Andrew Strathern:**
> - Ongka (famous big man)
> - Organized massive moka
> - Years of preparation
> - Documentary film
> - Demonstrated leadership through exchange

## Chief vs. Big Man (Sahlins)

### "Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief" (1963)

**Sahlins's Comparison:**

| Feature | Big Man (Melanesia) | Chief (Polynesia) |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Status** | Achieved | Ascribed (hereditary) |
| **Succession** | Non-hereditary | Hereditary |
| **Authority** | Personal, persuasive | Institutionalized, coercive |
| **Economic** | Accumulates to give away | Receives tribute, redistributes |
| **Legitimacy** | Personal achievement | Divine descent, genealogy |
| **Power** | Limited, temporary | Greater, permanent |
| **Structure** | Fragmented, competitive | Centralized, ranked |

**Big Man:**
- Works hard, accumulates, gives
- "Self-made man"
- Precarious position

**Chief:**
- Born to position
- Receives tribute
- Secure position (if maintains mana)

**Significance:**
- Shows variation in leadership
- Achieved vs. ascribed
- Different economic bases

**Critique:**
- Oversimplified
- Overlap exists
- Not absolute dichotomy

## Councils of Elders

### Gerontocracy

**Leadership by Elders:**
- Age = wisdom, knowledge, respect
- Collective decision-making
- No single ruler
- Deliberation, consensus

**Common In:**
- Many African societies
- Some Native American groups
- Pastoral societies

**Functions:**

**Knowledge:**
- Elders know genealogies, history
- Ritual specialists
- Custodians of tradition

**Mediation:**
- Resolve disputes
- Negotiate marriages
- Maintain order

**Authority:**
- Respect for age
- Supernatural sanctions (ancestors)
- Control ritual

> **Example: Tallensi (Ghana)**
>
> **Meyer Fortes:**
> - Lineage elders
> - Control ancestor shrines
> - Mediate disputes
> - No chiefs
> - Gerontocratic authority

> **Example: Somali Councils**
>
> **I.M. Lewis:**
> - Councils of elders (shir)
> - Lineage representatives
> - Discuss, negotiate
> - Consensus required
> - "Pastoral democracy"

**Limits:**
- Women excluded (typically)
- Young men subordinate
- Can be conservative

## Women and Leadership

### Gender and Authority

**General Pattern:**
- Men dominate formal political leadership cross-culturally
- But variation exists

**Exceptions:**

**1. Queen Mothers (West Africa):**
- Ashanti queen mother
- Important political role
- Advises, influences king selection
- Represents women

**2. Women Chiefs (Rare):**
- Some matrilineal societies (Iroquois)
- Women select chiefs (though chiefs male)
- Can remove chiefs

**3. Female Big Women (New Guinea):**
- Some societies recognize female big women
- Organize women's exchanges
- Parallel authority

**4. Spirit Mediums:**
- Women as mediums (Shona mhondoro)
- Spiritual authority
- Influence political decisions

**5. Monarchs:**
- Queen Elizabeth, Cleopatra, etc.
- Hereditary succession allows
- But usually if no male heirs

### Feminist Anthropological Analysis

**Explanations for Male Dominance:**

**1. Public/Private Divide (Rosaldo):**
- Men in public sphere (politics)
- Women in domestic sphere
- "Domestic-public" dichotomy
- *Critiqued as Western projection*

**2. Warfare (Divale & Harris):**
- Warfare = male activity
- Political leadership follows military
- *Critique: Not all societies warlike*

**3. Colonial Impact (Leacock):**
- Pre-colonial societies more egalitarian
- Colonialism imposed patriarchy
- Gendered hierarchy modern

**4. Multiple Factors:**
- No single cause
- Variable across societies
- Ideology, economy, history combine

**Contemporary:**
- Women's political participation increasing
- But inequality persists
- Anthropology documents variation

## Legitimacy and Sacred Authority

### Divine Kingship

**King = God or God's Representative:**

**Characteristics:**
- Sacred person
- Ritual functions central
- Cosmological role
- Not just political

**Examples:**

> **Pharaonic Egypt**
>
> - Pharaoh = living god (Horus)
> - Maintains cosmic order (ma'at)
> - Rituals ensure Nile floods, harvests
> - Death → becomes Osiris
> - Legitimacy through divinity

> **Japan (Pre-WWII)**
>
> - Emperor descended from sun goddess (Amaterasu)
> - Sacred person
> - After WWII, divinity renounced
> - Remains symbolic

> **Sacred Kings in Africa (Frazer, Hocart)**
>
> **"The Golden Bough":**
> - Divine kings (Shilluk, others)
> - Health of king = health of kingdom
> - If king weakens, kill and replace
> - Ensure cosmic renewal
>
> *Debated—may be exaggerated*

### Mana and Tapu (Polynesia)

**Mana:**
- Spiritual power/efficacy
- Chiefs have high mana (divine descent)
- Proves mana through success
- Can lose mana (failure, defeat, drought)

**Tapu (Taboo):**
- Sacred prohibitions
- Chiefs highly tapu
- Commoners can't touch, shadows, etc.
- Violations cause supernatural harm

**Political Function:**
- Legitimizes hierarchy
- Sacredness creates distance
- Violating tapu dangerous
- Chiefs enforce through spiritual sanctions

**But:**
- If lose mana, can be overthrown
- Success validates mana
- Failure shows loss of divine favor

## Symbolic Capital and Performativity

### Bourdieu: Symbolic Capital

**Capital Beyond Economic:**
- Economic (wealth)
- Social (connections)
- Cultural (education, taste)
- **Symbolic (prestige, honor, legitimacy)**

**Political Leaders:**
- Accumulate symbolic capital
- Displays, ceremonies, gifts
- Convert economic → symbolic
- Symbolic validates authority

**Potlatch Example:**
- Destroy wealth to gain symbolic capital
- Authority through conspicuous generosity

### Performance and Ritual

**Geertz: "Theatre State" (Bali)**

**Negara:**
- Bali pre-colonial states
- Ritual central
- Cremations, tooth-filings, temple ceremonies
- Political power through ceremony

**State as Theatre:**
- Performance validates authority
- Spectacle displays power
- Not just representation—constitutive
- Authority performed into being

**Critique:**
- Downplays coercion, economics
- But insight: ritual creates legitimacy

### Discourse and Hegemony

**Gramsci: Hegemony:**
- Ruling class rule through consent (not just force)
- Ideology makes domination seem natural
- Subordinate classes accept

**Anthropology:**
- How is consent manufactured?
- Rituals, symbols, discourse
- Legitimacy culturally constructed

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are big man systems more democratic than chiefdoms, or just differently hierarchical?

**Question 2:** Why is political leadership so gendered cross-culturally?

**Question 3:** Can charisma be manufactured, or is it inherently spontaneous?

**Question 4:** Do modern democracies have "rational-legal" authority or mix of all three (Weber's types)?

**Question 5:** Is all political authority ultimately based on force, or can "pure" consent exist?

**Remember:** Leadership varies enormously—achieved or ascribed, personal or institutional, sacred or secular. Weber's typology (traditional, charismatic, rational-legal) helps but oversimplifies. Big men persuade; chiefs command; elders deliberate; kings embody cosmic order. Authority must be legitimized—through tradition, personal qualities, divine mandate, ritual performance. Gender shapes leadership cross-culturally, usually excluding women from formal power (but with exceptions and variation). Understanding leadership reveals that political authority isn't natural—it's culturally constructed, performed, negotiated, and potentially contested.
