# Kinship Terminology Systems: Naming Relatives

---

## How Do You Say "Cousin"?

In English, your father's sister's daughter is your **"cousin."**

So is your mother's brother's son. And your father's brother's daughter. And your mother's sister's son.

**All cousins, right?**

**Not in many languages.**

Some languages distinguish:
- Father's side vs. mother's side cousins (different terms)
- Parallel cousins (parents' same-sex siblings' children) vs. cross-cousins (parents' opposite-sex siblings' children)
- Older vs. younger cousins
- Male vs. female cousins

**Why does this matter?**

Because **language reveals cultural logic**—what distinctions matter in organizing social life.

**Kinship terminology systems** = how languages classify and name relatives.

**Anthropology discovered:** Limited number of logical systems (about 6 main types), not infinite variation.

## What Are Kinship Terminologies?

### Kinship Terms vs. Genealogical Relationships

**Genealogical Relationship:** The actual biological/social connection (if traceable).

**Kinship Term:** The word you use to refer to/address that person.

**Key Insight:** **Same genealogical relationships get grouped differently in different languages.**

### Why Different Systems?

**Terminologies reflect:**
- Descent system (patrilineal, matrilineal, bilateral)
- Marriage rules (who can/can't marry)
- Residence patterns
- Social organization
- What distinctions matter socially

**Your terminology system teaches you:**
- Who is in your group
- Who you have obligations to
- Who you can marry
- How to behave toward different relatives

## Lewis Henry Morgan's Discovery

### The First Comparative Analysis (1871)

**Lewis Henry Morgan** (*Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity*):

**Noticed:** Iroquois used kinship terms very different from English.
- Father and father's brother = same term
- Mother and mother's sister = same term  
- But father's sister and mother's brother = different terms

**Collected:** Kinship terminologies from hundreds of societies worldwide.

**Found:** Limited patterns—not random variation but systematic differences.

**Theory:** Terminologies reflect social organization and evolve together.

**Legacy:** Founded kinship studies, though his evolutionary theory rejected.

## The Six Major Systems

**Classification by George Peter Murdock (1949):**

Based on how **cousins** are classified (key diagnostic feature).

### System 1: Hawaiian (Generational)

**Logic:** Minimize distinctions—same generation = same term.

**Rules:**
- All relatives of your generation called by same term (siblings/cousins merged)
- All relatives of parents' generation called by same term (parents/aunts/uncles merged)
- All relatives of grandparents' generation same term

**Cousin Terms:**
- NO separate "cousin" term
- Father's brother's children = siblings
- Mother's sister's children = siblings
- Father's sister's children = siblings
- Mother's brother's children = siblings
- **ALL are "siblings"**

**Parent Terms:**
- Father and father's brother = same term ("father")
- Mother and mother's sister = same term ("mother")
- Father's sister = same term as mother (all "mothers")
- Mother's brother = same term as father (all "fathers")

**Diagram:**
```
Generation +1: All "parents"
Generation 0: All "siblings"
Generation -1: All "children"
```

**Why This System?**

**Found in:**
- Polynesia (Hawaii, hence name)
- Some other Pacific societies

**Often associated with:**
- Cognatic/bilateral descent
- Ambilocal residence (flexible)
- Small populations (everyone related)
- Communal living

**Function:**
- Broad solidarity
- Flexible group membership
- De-emphasizes specific genealogical distance

> **Example: Traditional Hawaiian Terms**
>
> **Makua** = parent, uncle, aunt (all generation +1)
> **Kaikaina** = younger sibling/cousin (all generation 0, younger)
> **Kaikuaʻana** = older sibling/cousin (all generation 0, older)
>
> **Emphasizes:** Generation and relative age
> **De-emphasizes:** Line of descent, specific genealogical connection

**Modern echo:** When everyone in village is "auntie" or "uncle."

### System 2: Eskimo (Lineal)

**Logic:** Nuclear family vs. everyone else.

**Rules:**
- Distinguish lineal relatives (direct ancestors/descendants) from collateral (aunts, uncles, cousins)
- Parents distinguished from aunts/uncles
- Siblings distinguished from cousins
- But all cousins lumped together

**Cousin Terms:**
- ONE "cousin" term for ALL cousins
- Father's brother's children = cousins
- Mother's sister's children = cousins
- Father's sister's children = cousins
- Mother's brother's children = cousins

**Parent Terms:**
- Father ≠ father's brother (uncle)
- Mother ≠ mother's sister (aunt)
- Distinct terms for parents vs. aunts/uncles

**Diagram:**
```
Parents (special terms) vs. Aunts/Uncles (different terms)
Siblings (special terms) vs. Cousins (different terms)
```

**Why This System?**

**Found in:**
- United States, most of Europe
- Inuit (hence "Eskimo" name, though term now often avoided)
- Some foraging societies

**Associated with:**
- Bilateral descent
- Neolocal residence
- Nuclear family emphasis
- Industrial/modern societies

**Function:**
- Emphasizes nuclear family unit
- Distinguishes immediate from extended family
- Consistent with individual property ownership
- Residential independence

> **Example: English**
>
> **Parents:** mother, father (specific)
> **Parent's siblings:** aunt, uncle (generic)
> **Siblings:** brother, sister (specific)
> **Sibling's/cousin parents' children:** cousin (generic)
>
> **Core distinction:** My parents/siblings vs. everyone else

**Your system:** If you speak English, this is YOUR kinship terminology!

### System 3: Iroquois (Bifurcate Merging)

**Logic:** Merge parallel relatives, distinguish cross-relatives.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Parallel relatives:** Related through same-sex siblings
  - Father's brother (parallel to father)
  - Mother's sister (parallel to mother)
- **Cross relatives:** Related through opposite-sex siblings
  - Father's sister (cross to father)
  - Mother's brother (cross to mother)

**Cousin Terms:**
- **Parallel cousins = siblings**
  - Father's brother's children = siblings
  - Mother's sister's children = siblings
- **Cross-cousins = separate term ("cousin")**
  - Father's sister's children = cousins
  - Mother's brother's children = cousins

**Parent Terms:**
- Father and father's brother = same term ("father")
- Mother and mother's sister = same term ("mother")
- Father's sister = separate term (often translated "aunt")
- Mother's brother = separate term (often translated "uncle")

**Diagram:**
```
Father = Father's Brother ≠ Mother's Brother
Mother = Mother's Sister ≠ Father's Sister
Parallel cousins = Siblings ≠ Cross-cousins
```

**Why This System?**

**Found in:**
- Iroquois (Northeast Native American)
- Many other societies globally
- Common with unilineal descent

**Associated with:**
- Unilineal descent (patrilineal OR matrilineal)
- Cross-cousin marriage preferred
- Lineage exogamy

**Cultural Logic:**

**If patrilineal:**
- Father's brother in YOUR patrilineage = like father
- His children in YOUR patrilineage = like siblings
- Father's sister married OUT = different lineage
- Her children NOT in your lineage = marriage partners

**If matrilineal:**
- Mother's sister in YOUR matrilineage = like mother
- Her children in YOUR matrilineage = like siblings
- Mother's brother married OUT his children to different lineage
- They could be marriage partners

**Function:**
- Reinforces lineage membership
- Marks marriage boundaries (cross-cousins marryable)
- Creates alliance structures

> **Example: Iroquois Confederacy**
>
> Matrilineal clans:
> - Mother's sister = "mother"
> - Her children = "siblings" (same clan)
> - Father's sister married to different clan
> - Her children = potential marriage partners (different clan)

**Widespread:** Very common system globally.

### System 4: Crow (Matrilineal Variant)

**Logic:** Emphasize matrilineage membership above all.

**Extreme:** Override generational distinctions for patrilineal cross-relatives.

**Cousin Terms:**
- **Parallel cousins = siblings** (like Iroquois)
- **Cross-cousins:**
  - **Mother's brother's children = siblings** (same matrilineage as you)
  - **Father's sister's children:**
    - Her son = "father" (father's lineage, generationally elevated)
    - Her daughter = "father's sister"

**Weird Feature:**
Call your COUSIN "father"? Yes, if:
- You trace through matriline
- He's in father's matrilineage (different from yours)
- All father's matrilineage males = "father" to you

**Why This System?**

**Found in:**
- Crow (Plains Native American, hence name)
- Other strongly matrilineal societies

**Associated with:**
- Strong matrilineal descent
- Matrilineal clan exogamy

**Cultural Logic:**
- Membership in matrilineage MOST important
- More important than generation
- Father's sister's children in father's matrilineage = related through fathers
- So call them as you'd call father's lineage members

**Function:**
- Maximally emphasizes matrilineage
- Blurs generations in cross-lineages
- Maintains clear lineage boundaries

**Confusing:** Yes! But internally logical if matrilineage is paramount.

### System 5: Omaha (Patrilineal Variant)

**Logic:** Mirror image of Crow—emphasize patrilineage.

**Cousin Terms:**
- **Parallel cousins = siblings** (like Iroquois)
- **Cross-cousins:**
  - **Father's sister's children = siblings** (same patrilineage)
  - **Mother's brother's children:**
    - His son = "mother's brother"
    - His daughter = "mother" (generationally elevated)

**Weird Feature:**
Call your cousin "mother"? Yes, if:
- She's in mother's patrilineage
- All mother's patrilineage females = "mother" to you

**Found in:**
- Omaha (Plains Native American)
- Other strongly patrilineal societies

**Associated with:**
- Strong patrilineal descent
- Patrilineal clan exogamy

**Cultural Logic:**
Same as Crow but flipped—patrilineage paramount, overrides generation in cross-lineages.

**Both Crow and Omaha:**
- Complex systems
- Rare (most unilineal societies use Iroquois)
- Extreme lineage emphasis

### System 6: Sudanese (Descriptive)

**Logic:** Maximize distinctions—different term for each type of relative.

**Rules:**
- Distinguish all eight types of cousins
- Distinguish all four types of aunts/uncles
- Most terms are unique, descriptive

**Cousin Terms:**
- Father's brother's son = specific term #1
- Father's brother's daughter = specific term #2
- Father's sister's son = specific term #3
- Father's sister's daughter = specific term #4
- Mother's brother's son = specific term #5
- Mother's brother's daughter = specific term #6
- Mother's sister's son = specific term #7
- Mother's sister's daughter = specific term #8

**Parent Terms:**
- Father, mother, father's brother, father's sister, mother's brother, mother's sister = all different terms

**Why This System?**

**Found in:**
- Arabic-speaking societies (Sudan, North Africa, Middle East)
- Some other stratified societies

**Associated with:**
- Complex descent systems
- High political stratification
- Endogamy preferences (cousin marriage)
- Status differences important

**Cultural Logic:**
- Each relative has specific social status
- Marriage politics complex (preferential parallel cousin marriage)
- Precise tracking of relationships essential
- Inheritance and political alliances

> **Example: Arabic Kinship**
>
> Preferential FBD (father's brother's daughter) marriage:
> - Keep property in patrilineage
> - Strengthen lineage solidarity
> - Need to distinguish her specifically
> - She's preferred marriage partner
> - Complex terminology tracks these relationships

**Most complex system:** Requires extensive vocabulary, precise tracking.

## What Terminologies Reveal

### 1. Social Organization

Terminology = window into social structure.
- Hawaiian → small, flexible groups
- Eskimo → nuclear family emphasis
- Iroquois → lineage groups important

### 2. Marriage Rules

Terminology often matches marriage patterns.
- Iroquois → cross-cousin marriage allowed/preferred
- Sudanese → parallel cousin marriage preferred

### 3. Residence

Where you live shapes whom you're around.
- Patrilocal → emphasize father's side
- Matrilocal → emphasize mother's side

### 4. Cultural Logic

Not arbitrary—each system internally logical given social context.

## Debates and Critiques

### Schneider's Critique

**David Schneider (1984):** "Kinship" itself is Western concept.

**Argued:**
- Anthropologists imposed Western "kinship" category
- Assumed blood/biology universal basis
- But many cultures don't organize relatedness by biology
- Kinship studies ethnocentric

**Impact:** Shook field, led to rethinking.

**Response:**
- Valid critique of biological assumptions
- But relatedness IS universal human concern
- Just organized differently
- Need cultural analysis, not biological

### Contemporary Approaches

**Focus on:**
- How relatedness is culturally constituted
- Practice (what people do, not just terminology)
- Emotion and meaning, not just structure
- New kinship forms (adoption, IVF, same-sex)

**Terminology still valuable:** Shows how language structures social categories.

---

## Contemporary Transformations

### Changing Systems

**Globalization:**
- English spreading → Eskimo terms borrowed
- Younger generations using fewer kin terms
- Urbanization weakening extended kin ties

**New Forms:**
- Blended families (steprelatives—how to term?)
- Same-sex couples (two mothers/two fathers?)
- Adoption (biological vs. social kin)
- IVF/surrogacy (multiple "mothers")

**Terminology struggles:** Languages adapting to new realities.

> **Example: English "Parent" Innovations**
>
> - Birth mother, adoptive mother
> - Biological father, stepdad, father figure
- Co-parent
> - Mom and mommy (lesbian couple's children)
>
> **Expanding terminology to accommodate new kinship forms.**

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** What's your kinship terminology system? (Likely Eskimo if English speaker.) Can you see its cultural logic?

**Question 2:** How would you explain to your cousin why some languages call them "sibling"?

**Question 3:** Do kinship terminologies still matter in modern, mobile societies? Or are they becoming obsolete?

**Question 4:** How do you think English terminology will adapt to new family forms (same-sex marriage, IVF, etc.)?

**Question 5:** Is Schneider right that "kinship" is a Western category we shouldn't impose universally?

**Remember:** Kinship terminology isn't just vocabulary—it's a cultural classification system showing what distinctions matter. Hawaiian systems care about generation; Eskimo systems care about nuclear family; Iroquois systems care about lineage and marriage boundaries; Crow/Omaha systems care about lineage above all; Sudanese systems care about precise status. Your terminology teaches you how to organize your social world. These systems seem complex or even bizarre until you understand their internal logic—then they make perfect sense. And studying them reveals that even something as "natural" as family is culturally constructed.
