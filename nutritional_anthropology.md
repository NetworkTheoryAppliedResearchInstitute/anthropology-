# Nutritional Anthropology: Diet, Growth, and Development

---

## What Is Nutritional Anthropology?

### Biocultural Approach to Food

**Definition:**
- Study of human nutrition
- Biological needs + cultural practices
- Ecological constraints
- Evolutionary context

**Biocultural:**
- Biology affects what we need
- Culture affects what we eat
- Environment affects what's available
- Health outcomes from interaction

**Questions:**
- What do humans eat?
- Why dietary variation?
- How does diet affect health?
- Optimal diets?
- Evolution of diet?

---

## Human Dietary Flexibility

### Omnivores

**Generalist:**
- Can eat plants and animals
- Wide range
- Adaptable

**Contrast:**
- Carnivores (obligate meat)
- Herbivores (specialized)
- Humans: flexible

**Evolutionary Advantage:**
- Survive in diverse environments
- Arctic (Inuit: meat, fat)
- Desert (Hadza: tubers, honey, meat)
- Tropical (varied)

**Culture Determines:**
- What's "food"
- Insects (many cultures), taboo (Western)
- Dogs, horses (eaten some places)
- Beef (taboo Hindu), pork (taboo Muslim/Jewish)

---

## Paleolithic Diet

### What Did Ancestors Eat?

**"Caveman Diet" Claims:**
- Modern fad
- Supposed "natural" diet
- Meat, vegetables, no grains

**Reality:**
- Enormous variation (geography, climate)
- Opportunistic
- Not single "Paleo diet"

**Evidence:**

**Isotope Analysis:**
- Bone collagen (nitrogen, carbon)
- Shows diet (plant vs. animal)
- Neanderthals: meat heavy (carnivores)
- Early modern humans: more varied

**Dental Microwear:**
- Scratches, pits on teeth
- Hard foods (nuts, seeds) vs. tough (meat)
- Variation

**Coprolites:**
- Fossilized feces
- Seeds, pollen, parasites

**General Pattern:**
- Pre-agriculture: varied, seasonal
- High protein (hunted/fished)
- Wild plants (tubers, fruits, nuts)
- Honey (when available)
- Few grains (not staple)

**Not "Optimal":**
- Mortality high
- Malnutrition
- Feast/famine
- Modern agriculture → more calories

---

## Agricultural Transition

### Dietary Shift

**Neolithic Revolution:**
- Agriculture begins (~10,000 years ago)
- Domestication (plants, animals)
- Sedentism

**Dietary Changes:**
- Reliance on few crops
- Carbohydrates dominant
- Less protein variety
- Less dietary diversity

**Health Consequences:**
- Shorter stature (bioarchaeology shows)
- More dental caries
- Nutritional deficiencies (anemia)
- New diseases (zoonoses from animals)
- Infectious disease (crowding)

**Paradox:**
- More food (calories)
- But: poorer quality
- Population grew
- Individuals less healthy

**Mark Cohen:**
- "The Food Crisis in Prehistory" (1977)
- Agriculture = necessity, not choice
- Population pressure

---

## Malnutrition

### Undernutrition

**Protein-Energy Malnutrition:**

**Marasmus:**
- Severe calorie deficiency
- Wasting (muscle, fat loss)
- Thin, weak
- Children

**Kwashiorkor:**
- Protein deficiency (with some calories)
- Edema (swelling, fluid retention)
- Belly distended
- Hair, skin changes
- Post-weaning (breast milk → low-protein diet)

**Causes:**
- Poverty
- War, famine
- Displacement
- Food insecurity

**Global:**
- Millions of children
- Stunting (chronic undernutrition)
- Wasting (acute)
- WHO tracks

**Synergistic:**
- Malnutrition + infection
- Each worsens the other
- "Syndemics" (Singer)

---

### Micronutrient Deficiencies

**"Hidden Hunger":**
- Enough calories
- But: lack vitamins, minerals

**Iron Deficiency Anemia:**
- Most common worldwide
- Fatigue, weakness
- Children, women (menstruation, pregnancy)
- Causes: diet, parasites
- Porotic hyperostosis (ancient)

**Vitamin A Deficiency:**
- Blindness (leading preventable cause)
- Immune system
- Children vulnerable

**Iodine Deficiency:**
- Goiter (thyroid swelling)
- Intellectual disability (severe, in utero)
- Salt iodization (public health success)

**Vitamin D Deficiency:**
- Rickets (children), osteomalacia (adults)
- Sunlight needed (synthesis)
- Dark skin + low UV (high latitudes)
- Industrial cities (smoke blocks sun)

**Folic Acid:**
- Neural tube defects (spina bifida)
- Pregnancy crucial
- Fortification (flour, cereal)

**Scurvy (Vitamin C):**
- Rare now
- Sailors (long voyages)
- Bleeding, tooth loss

---

## Overnutrition

### Obesity and Chronic Disease

**Epidemic:**
- Developed countries
- Increasing globally (nutrition transition)
- Health crisis

**Causes:**
- Caloric surplus
- Processed foods (cheap, calorie-dense)
- Sugar, fat
- Sedentary lifestyle

**Health Consequences:**
- Diabetes (type 2)
- Cardiovascular disease
- Stroke
- Some cancers
- Arthritis

**Thrifty Genotype Hypothesis:**
- James Neel (1962)
- Genes for fat storage
- Adaptive (famine/feast past)
- Maladaptive (modern plenty)
- **Controversial, debated**
- Oversimplified?
- Blames biology, ignores social factors

**Nutrition Transition:**
- Shift from traditional to Western diet
- Processed, high-calorie, low-nutrient
- Globalization
- Fast food
- Coca-Colonization

**Indigenous Peoples:**
- Pima (Arizona): high diabetes
- Shifted diet (traditional → Western)
- Poverty, food deserts
- Structural violence

---

## Growth and Development

### Life History Theory

**K-Selection:**
- Humans: slow growth, long life
- Few offspring, high investment
- Large brains

**Growth Patterns:**

**Prenatal:**
- 9 months gestation
- Brain growth rapid

**Infancy (0-3 years):**
- Rapid growth
- Weaning (extended human)
- Brain development

**Childhood (3-7 years):**
- Slow, steady growth
- Learning intensive
- Dependent

**Juvenile (7-10 years):**
- Pre-adolescent
- Skills development

**Adolescence:**
- Growth spurt
- Sexual maturation
- Secondary sex characteristics

**Adulthood:**
- Growth stops (~18-20)
- Reproduction

**Senescence:**
- Aging
- Menopause (unique? Or shared with some whales)

---

## Secular Trend

### Populations Getting Taller

**Observation:**
- Height increasing (generations)
- Europe, N. America (19th-20th C)
- Japan (post-WWII dramatic)

**Causes:**
- Better nutrition
- Disease reduction
- Sanitation
- Healthcare

**Not Genetic:**
- Too fast (1-2 generations)
- Environment

**Leveling Off:**
- Developed countries (plateau)
- Optimal reached?

**Developing Countries:**
- Still increasing
- As nutrition improves

---

## Stunting and Wasting

### Child Malnutrition

**Stunting:**
- Short for age
- Chronic undernutrition
- Irreversible (mostly)
- Cognitive impacts

**Wasting:**
- Thin for height
- Acute malnutrition
- Reversible (if treated)

**WHO Tracks:**
- Millions affected
- Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia
- Poverty, food insecurity

**Intergenerational:**
- Malnourished mothers → low birth weight
- Cycle continues

---

## Catch-Up Growth

### Recovery

**Possible:**
- If nutrition improves
- Children resilient
- Catch up (partially)

**Limits:**
- Critical periods
- Brain development windows
- Full recovery difficult (severe stunting)

**Intervention:**
- Nutritional supplementation
- Therapeutic feeding
- Public health

---

## Developmental Plasticity

### Fetal Programming

**Barker Hypothesis:**
- David Barker (1990s)
- In utero environment affects adult health
- "Fetal origins of adult disease"

**Mechanism:**
- Fetus adapts to maternal nutrition
- Low nutrition → "thrifty" metabolism
- If born into abundance → mismatch
- Obesity, diabetes, heart disease

**Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-45):**
- WWII famine (Netherlands)
- Pregnant women starved
- Offspring studied (decades)
- Higher rates: obesity, diabetes, heart disease
- Epigenetic changes

**Predictive Adaptive Response:**
- Fetus "predicts" future environment
- Thrifty metabolism if scarcity expected
- Mismatch if wrong prediction

**Critique:**
- Deterministic?
- Overemphasized?
- But: evidence strong

---

## Lactation and Weaning

### Infant Feeding

**Breast Milk:**
- Optimal (first 6 months WHO)
- Antibodies (immune protection)
- Bonding
- Nutrition

**Weaning:**
- Transition to solid food
- Timing varies (cultural)
- WHO: 2+ years ideal
- Weaning crisis (high mortality historically)

**Formula:**
- Alternative (modern)
- Convenient
- But: lacks antibodies
- Contamination risk (poor sanitation)
- Expensive

**Nestlé Boycott (1977):**
- Aggressive marketing (developing countries)
- Mothers abandoned breastfeeding
- Unsafe water → infant deaths
- Ethical scandal

**Kwashiorkor:**
- Often post-weaning
- Low-protein diet replaces breast milk

---

## Traditional Diets

### Indigenous Food Systems

**Inuit:**
- High fat, high protein
- Marine mammals (seal, whale)
- Fish
- Few plants (Arctic)
- Raw (frozen)
- Healthy (historically)
- Modern: diabetes (Western foods)

**Mediterranean:**
- Olive oil, fish, vegetables, grains
- Wine (moderate)
- "Heart healthy"
- Long life (longevity)

**Japanese (Traditional):**
- Fish, rice, vegetables, soy
- Low fat
- Longevity
- Modern: Westernizing

**Hadza (Tanzania):**
- Hunter-gatherers
- Tubers, honey, meat, berries
- Varied, seasonal
- Lean, healthy
- Microbiome diversity (high)

**Lesson:**
- Many "healthy" diets
- Whole foods, diverse
- Traditional knowledge
- Modern processed = unhealthy

---

## Food Taboos

### Cultural Rules

**Examples:**
- Hindu: no beef (sacred cow)
- Muslim/Jewish: no pork
- Jain: vegetarian, no root vegetables
- Some: no insects (Western)

**Functions:**

**Marvin Harris (Materialist):**
- Ecological, economic reasons
- Pigs (Middle East): compete for resources, no advantage
- Cows (India): more valuable alive (milk, traction)

**Mary Douglas (Symbolic):**
- Purity, pollution
- Anomalous animals (pigs: not cud-chewing, not split hoof)
- Category confusion

**Both Explain:**
- Taboos multifunctional
- Practical + symbolic

---

## Cannibalism

### Controversial

**Types:**

**Endocannibalism:**
- Eat own group (deceased)
- Mortuary ritual
- Wari' (Brazil, Conklin)
- Compassion, grief
- Stopped mid-20th C

**Exocannibalism:**
- Eat enemies
- Warfare
- Tupinambá (Brazil)
- Ritual, incorporate power

**Survival Cannibalism:**
- Extreme circumstances (starvation)
- Donner Party (1846-47)
- Andes plane crash (1972)

**Debate:**
- How common?
- Arens: "The Man-Eating Myth" (1979)
  - Exaggerated, racist stereotypes
  - Colonial projection

**Evidence:**
- Some cases archaeological (cut marks, burning)
- Anasazi? (Southwest US, debated)
- But: rarer than claimed

**Kuru:**
- Papua New Guinea (Fore people)
- Prion disease (like mad cow)
- Mortuary cannibalism (brains)
- Stopped 1960s
- Medical discovery (Gajdusek, Nobel)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is there an "optimal" human diet?

**Question 2:** Did agriculture make us healthier or sicker?

**Question 3:** Is obesity an evolutionary mismatch or social problem?

**Question 4:** Should we return to "Paleo" diet?

**Question 5:** How much does early nutrition determine adult health?

**Remember:** Nutritional anthropology takes biocultural approach—biology + culture + environment. Humans omnivores, dietary flexibility (Arctic Inuit meat/fat to tropical varied). Paleolithic diet enormously varied, not single optimal diet. Agricultural transition increased calories but poorer health (shorter stature, more caries, anemia, infectious disease)—Cohen/Armelagos paradox. Malnutrition: protein-energy (marasmus wasting, kwashiorkor edema post-weaning), micronutrient "hidden hunger" (iron, vitamin A, iodine, vitamin D, folic acid). Overnutrition: obesity epidemic, nutrition transition (traditional→Western processed foods), thrifty genotype hypothesis controversial. Growth patterns: K-selection slow, secular trend (populations taller with better nutrition), stunting/wasting chronic vs. acute malnutrition. Developmental plasticity: Barker hypothesis fetal programming (Dutch Hunger Winter—offspring obesity/diabetes), predictive adaptive response. Lactation optimal, weaning crisis, Nestlé boycott ethical scandal. Traditional diets diverse healthy (Inuit, Mediterranean, Japanese, Hadza). Food taboos functional (Harris materialist, Douglas symbolic). Cannibalism exaggerated but some evidence (kuru prion disease Fore). Understanding nutritional anthropology reveals diet shapes health, biology and culture interact, no single optimal diet, modern processed foods problematic, early nutrition impacts lifespan.
