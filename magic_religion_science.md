# Magic, Religion, and Science: Shamanism and Spirit Possession

---

## Distinguishing Magic, Religion, and Science

### The Classic Distinction (Frazer, Malinowski)

**James Frazer: "The Golden Bough" (1890)**

**Three Stages of Human Thought:**
1. **Magic** (primitive)
2. **Religion** (intermediate)
3. **Science** (advanced)

**Evolution:**
- Humanity progresses through stages
- Magic → Religion → Science

**Magic:**
- **Sympathetic magic** (similarity, contagion)
- Imitative (like produces like)
- Contagious (things once connected remain so)
- Pseudo-science (wrong theory, right logic)
- Will be replaced by science

**Examples:**

**Imitative Magic:**
- Voodoo doll (harm image = harm person)
- Rain-making (pour water = bring rain)
- Hunting magic (act out killing prey)

**Contagious Magic:**
- Hair, nails remain connected to person
- Destroy hair = harm person
- Touch king's garment = receive power

**Problems with Frazer:**
- Armchair anthropology (never did fieldwork)
- Evolutionist (discredited)
- "Primitive" = pejorative
- Too intellectualist

### Malinowski's Revision

**Bronislaw Malinowski: "Magic, Science, and Religion" (1948)**

**All Coexist:**
- Not evolutionary stages
- Every society has all three
- Different domains

**Magic:**
- **Instrumental** (achieve practical goals)
- Used when control limited
- Reduce anxiety

**Religion:**
- **Ultimate concerns** (death, meaning)
- Sacred, social
- Worship, community

**Science:**
- **Empirical knowledge** (gardening, navigation)
- Practical, testable
- All societies have

**Trobriand Example:**

**Gardening:**
- Science: plant yams, weed, harvest (empirical knowledge)
- Magic: spells to ensure growth (uncertainty)
- Religion: honor ancestors (ultimate meaning)

**Fishing:**
- **Lagoon** (safe, predictable):
  - Science (techniques)
  - No magic needed
- **Open sea** (dangerous, uncertain):
  - Science (techniques)
  - **Plus magic** (protect, ensure catch)

**Insight:**
- Magic supplements, doesn't replace
- Used where uncertainty high
- Psychological function (confidence)

**Critique:**
- Still separates domains
- Western bias
- Many societies don't distinguish

## Beyond the Trichotomy

### Evans-Pritchard: "Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande" (1937)

**Azande (Sudan):**

**Witchcraft Explains Misfortune:**
- Granary collapses, kills person
- Azande know termites weaken (science)
- But why collapse when person sitting there?
- **Witchcraft** explains particular event

**Not "Irrational":**
- Different logic, internally coherent
- Witchcraft explains "why me, why now?"
- Science explains "how"

**Oracles:**
- Poison oracle (benge)
- Feed poison to chicken, ask question
- Chicken survives or dies = answer
- Used for major decisions

**From Outside (Etic):**
- Oracle is probabilistic (50/50)
- Clever social system for decision-making

**From Inside (Emic):**
- Oracle works, reveals truth
- Trusted completely

**Evans-Pritchard's Insight:**
- Can't separate magic from religion from science easily
- Witchcraft is Azande's science (explains causation)
- Also their morality, justice system

**Closed System:**
- Unfalsifiable
- If oracle wrong, blame witchcraft interfering, or poison bad, or operator
- System adjusts, persists

### Robin Horton: African Thought and Western Science

**Similarities:**
- Both seek to explain, predict, control
- Both theoretical
- African gods/spirits = Western atoms/forces (theoretical entities)

**Differences:**
- **Open vs. Closed** (debated)
  - Science open to revision?
  - African thought closed?
- **Kuhn's paradigms:** Science also "closed" within paradigm

**Critique:**
- Overstates similarity
- Ignores power, colonialism

## Shamanism

### What Is a Shaman?

**Mircea Eliade: "Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy" (1951)**

**Shaman:**
- Religious specialist
- **Ecstatic trance** (soul journeys)
- Mediates between human and spirit worlds
- Heals, divines, guides souls

**Not:**
- Priest (conducts rituals)
- Medium (passive vessel)

**Active:**
- Shaman controls spirits
- Journeys to spirit world
- Retrieves souls, negotiates with spirits

**Siberian Origin:**
- Word from Tungus (Siberia)
- Spread globally by anthropologists
- Now applied widely (debated)

### Shamanistic Practices

**Soul Journey:**
- Shaman's soul leaves body
- Travels to sky, underworld
- Meets spirits, ancestors, deities
- Retrieves lost souls
- Battles malevolent spirits

**Trance:**
- Induced by:
  - Drumming, dancing
  - Psychoactive plants (ayahuasca, peyote, mushrooms)
  - Fasting, isolation
  - Sleep deprivation
- Altered state essential

**Healing:**
- Illness = soul loss, spirit intrusion, sorcery
- Shaman diagnoses (divination)
- Retrieves soul or extracts intrusion
- Restores balance

> **Example: Yanomami Shamans (Amazon)**
>
> - Ingest yãkoana (psychoactive snuff)
> - Hekura spirits descend
> - Shamans become vehicles
> - Dance, chant
> - Heal, harm enemies
> - Control spirits

> **Example: Inuit Angakkuit**
>
> - Angakkuq = shaman
> - Soul journeys to sea goddess Sedna
> - Comb her hair, appease
> - Ensure marine animals available
> - Heal sick
> - Control weather

### Becoming a Shaman

**Initiatory Crisis:**
- Serious illness, near-death
- Visions, spirits appear
- Dismemberment, death, rebirth (symbolic)
- Given power by spirits

**Training:**
- Older shaman teaches
- Learn songs, techniques
- Acquire helping spirits
- Years of practice

**Not Everyone:**
- Special calling
- Often hereditary tendency
- But open to those spirits choose

**Social Role:**
- Respected but ambiguous
- Powerful, dangerous
- Can heal or harm
- Outside normal social structure

### Critique of "Shamanism"

**Too Broad?**
- Applied to diverse practices
- Loses specificity
- Siberian ≠ Amazonian ≠ African

**Atkinson:** "Shamanism today" is academic construct, not unified phenomenon.

**But Useful:**
- Comparative category
- Recognizes patterns (ecstatic trance, mediation, healing)

## Spirit Possession

### What Is Spirit Possession?

**Contrast with Shamanism:**

**Shamanism:**
- Shaman's soul leaves
- Travels to spirits
- Active control

**Possession:**
- Spirit enters person
- Person becomes vessel
- Possessed person may lose consciousness/control

**But Overlap:**
- Not absolute distinction
- Some traditions mix

### Types of Possession

**Voluntary vs. Involuntary:**

**Voluntary:**
- Sought, cultivated
- Ritual context
- Controlled
- Prestigious

**Involuntary:**
- Unwanted
- Illness, misfortune
- Must be exorcised or managed

**Lewis's Distinction:**

**I.M. Lewis: "Ecstatic Religion" (1971)**

**Central Possession:**
- Elite, male
- Controlled, legitimate
- Public, prestigious

**Peripheral Possession:**
- Marginalized (women, poor)
- Involuntary initially
- Becomes coping, power
- Subversive

### Examples Worldwide

> **Haitian Vodou**
>
> - **Lwa (spirits) mount "horses" (devotees)**
> - Possession ritual (fèt)
> - Drumming, dancing, offerings
> - Lwa speaks, advises, heals
> - Priest/priestess (houngan/mambo) guides
> - Elaborate pantheon
> - Syncretism (African + Catholic)
>
> **Ethnography:**
> - Karen McCarthy Brown, "Mama Lola"
> - Possession as relationship with lwa
> - Communal ritual
> - Healing, divination

> **Zar Possession (North Africa, Middle East)**
>
> **I.M. Lewis's Classic Case:**
> - Women possessed by zar spirits
> - Illness, distress
> - Neglected by husbands
> - Zar demands gifts, attention
> - Husband provides
> - Women gain leverage
>
> **"Peripheral Possession":**
> - Marginalized women
> - Indirect power
> - Ritual community of possessed women
> - Lifelong relationship with zar

> **Candomblé (Brazil)**
>
> - African-Brazilian religion
> - Orixás (deities) possess devotees
> - Elaborate ceremonies
> - Dancing, costuming
- Orixás recognized by behavior
> - Initiation (making saint)
> - Years of training
> - Prestigious possession

> **Mhondoro (Shona, Zimbabwe)**
>
> - Spirit mediums
> - Ancestors possess
> - Political authority
> - Mediums advise chiefs
> - Legitimize rulers
> - **Guerrilla war (1970s):** Mediums supported fighters, blessed weapons

### Possession and Gender

**Women Predominate:**
- Many possession cults female-majority
- Why?

**Explanations:**

**1. Deprivation (Lewis):**
- Women excluded from formal power
- Possession = indirect power
- Spirit demands can't be refused

**2. Emotional Expression:**
- Possession allows expression
- Culturally legitimate "madness"

**3. Ambiguity:**
- Women liminal (married out, retain ties)
- Mediate boundaries
- Spirits also liminal

**Critique:**
- Romanticizes oppression?
- Assumes possession is "resistance"
- But also: genuine religious experience

**Janice Boddy (Sudan):**
- Zar not just resistance
- Also cosmology, aesthetics, pleasure
- Can't reduce to function

## Performance and Embodiment

### Possession as Performance

**Not "Fake":**
- Real to participants
- Socially recognized
- Effects real

**But Also:**
- Culturally scripted
- Learn how to be possessed
- Recognize spirits by behavior

**Trance:**
- Altered consciousness (measurable)
- But also performative
- Both/and

**Erika Bourguignon:**
- Institutionalized trance (90% societies)
- Institutionalized possession trance (fewer)
- Cultural patterns

### Embodied Experience

**Not Just Belief:**
- Bodily experience
- Visceral, transformative
- Feeling spirits

**Phenomenology:**
- What's it like?
- First-person experience
- Csordas: "embodiment paradigm"

**Anthropology of the Body:**
- Bodies culturally shaped
- Possession trains bodies
- Different body techniques (Mauss)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can Western psychology (dissociation, hypnosis) explain possession, or is that reductionist?

**Question 2:** Is shamanism always individual, or can there be "collective shamanism"?

**Question 3:** Does spirit possession empower marginalized people, or just provide illusion of power?

**Question 4:** Are magic and science fundamentally different, or just different paradigms?

**Question 5:** What counts as "altered consciousness" in your culture?

- Session 16: African religions, Asian religions, syncretism

**Classic Texts:**
- Evans-Pritchard, E.E. (1937). *Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande*
- Eliade, Mircea. (1951). *Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy*
- Lewis, I.M. (1971). *Ecstatic Religion*
- Boddy, Janice. (1989). *Wombs and Alien Spirits*

**Remember:** Magic, religion, and science aren't evolutionary stages (Frazer wrong)—all coexist (Malinowski). Magic addresses uncertainty instrumentally. Evans-Pritchard showed Azande witchcraft is coherent, rational system explaining misfortune. Shamanism involves ecstatic soul journeys, spirit control, healing—shaman active mediator. Spirit possession involves spirits entering devotees, who become vessels—common globally, often women, can provide power for marginalized. Both shamanism and possession are embodied practices, not just beliefs. Understanding these reveals diverse ways humans engage spiritual worlds, heal, divine, and navigate uncertainty—practices Western categories (magic/religion/science) struggle to contain.
