# Food Culture and Commensality: Eating as Symbolic Practice

---

## Food Is Never "Just Food"

**Eating = Cultural Act:**
- What we eat
- How we eat
- With whom we eat
- When we eat
- All culturally patterned, meaningful

**Claude Lévi-Strauss:**
"Food is good to think with"

**Functions Beyond Nutrition:**
- Identity (ethnic, class, gender)
- Social bonding (commensality)
- Status and power
- Ritual and religion
- Pleasure and aesthetics
- Morality

## Claude Lévi-Strauss: The Culinary Triangle

### "The Raw and the Cooked" (1964)

**Basic Opposition:**
- **Raw** = Nature
- **Cooked** = Culture
- Cooking = fundamental transformation

**The Triangle:**
```
        Cooked (Culture)
       /                \
   Roasted          Boiled
      \                /
         Raw (Nature)
```

**Roasted:**
- Direct fire
- Less cultural mediation
- Associated with men, wild

**Boiled:**
- Pot, water, containment
- More cultural mediation
- Associated with women, domestic

**Rotten:**
- Returns to nature
- Decay

**Symbolic System:**
- Not just cooking techniques
- Cosmological meanings
- Nature/culture boundary

**Critique:**
- Universalizing
- Gendered assumptions
- But: insight that cooking = symbolic

## Mary Douglas: Food as Code

### "Deciphering a Meal" (1972)

**Meals Have Structure:**
- Not random
- Grammatical rules
- Meanings through contrasts

**English Meal Structure:**

**Sunday Roast (Paradigmatic):**
- Roast meat (main)
- Potatoes (staple)
- Vegetables
- Gravy
- Dessert

**Variations:**
- Weekday meals simpler
- Special occasions elaborate
- Structure persists

**Meal = Statement:**
- Who we are
- Occasion (everyday, special)
- Relationships

**Purity and Food:**
- Boundaries maintained
- Proper categories
- "Don't mix" rules

**Example: Kashrut**
- Separate meat and dairy
- Category maintenance
- Symbolic order

## Sidney Mintz: "Sweetness and Power" (1985)

### Sugar and Capitalism

**Historical Ethnography:**
- Sugar: luxury → necessity
- Caribbean plantations
- Slavery
- British working class

**Transformations:**

**Production:**
- Sugar plantations
- Enslaved African labor
- Brutal conditions
- Capitalist agriculture

**Consumption:**
- Britain: luxury (17th century)
- Mass consumption (19th century)
- Tea + sugar (working class)
- Energy for industrial workers

**Power:**
- Slavery funded industrialization
- Sugar = cheap calories
- Working class productivity
- Empire, capitalism, race intertwined

**Meaning:**
- Sweetness = pleasure, status
- Later: comfort, energy
- Class changes

**Anthropology of Commodity:**
- Trace global connections
- Production and consumption
- Symbolic and material

## Marvin Harris: Cultural Materialism and Food

### "Good to Eat" (1985)

**Materialist Explanation:**
- Food taboos have practical reasons
- Ecology, economy
- Not just symbolic

**Examples:**

**Hindu Sacred Cow:**
- Why not eat cows?
- **Practical:** More valuable alive (plow, milk, dung)
- Protein from milk > one-time meat
- Ecological adaptation

**Pork Taboo (Jewish, Muslim):**
- Why forbidden?
- **Practical:** Pigs compete with humans (grain)
- Don't provide milk, plow
- Disease (trichinosis)
- Heat stress (Middle East)

**Cannibalism (Aztec):**
- Protein scarcity?
- Harris: supplemented diet
- Debate: symbolic vs. nutritional

**Critique:**
- Reductionist (just material?)
- Ignores meaning
- But: material matters

**Response:**
- Not either/or
- Both material AND symbolic

---

## Food Taboos and Identity

### What We Don't Eat Defines Us

**Food Boundaries:**
- Mark insiders/outsiders
- Ethnic, religious, national identity
- "We don't eat that"

**Examples:**

> **Dog Meat**
>
> - Eaten: Korea, China (some), Vietnam
> - Taboo: US, UK, most of West
> - Emotional reactions (Western: "barbaric")
> - Koreans: beef taboo strange (Hindus)
> - Relativism challenge

> **Insects**
>
> - Eaten: 80% of world's cultures
> - High protein, sustainable
> - Western taboo (disgust)
> - But: shrimp okay (also arthropods)
> - Category boundaries

> **Horse Meat**
>
> - France: normal
> - UK/US: taboo (horses = companions, sports)
> - Iceland: puffin, whale
> - Cultural variation

**Disgust:**
- Socially learned
- Protects symbolic boundaries
- "Pollution"

**Frederick Simoons, "Eat Not This Flesh":**
- Survey food taboos
- Religious, ethnic, historical
- Cattle, pigs, fish, etc.
- Variable globally

## Commensality: Eating Together

### Commensal = "At the Same Table"

**Social Bonding:**
- Sharing food creates intimacy
- Obligations
- Trust

**Marcel Mauss:**
- Eating together = exchange
- Gift of food
- Reciprocity

**Boundaries:**
- Who eats together matters
- Caste (India): pollution from eating with lower
- Gender segregation (many societies)
- Family meals = intimacy

### Examples

> **Trobriand Islands (Malinowski)**
>
> - Food gifts (urigubu) = politics
> - Chiefs receive yams
> - Redistribute
> - Eating together rare (suspicion of poison)
> - Food loaded with power

> **!Kung San**
>
> - Meat sharing essential
> - Hunter distributes
> - Everyone receives
> - Egalitarian sharing
> - "Insulting the meat" (prevent boasting)

> **Mediterranean Honor-Shame**
>
> - Hospitality sacred
> - Guest must be fed
> - Refusal = insult
> - Commensality = alliance

> **Japan (Ohnuki-Tierney)**
>
> - Rice = Japanese identity
> - Not just food—"self"
> - Purity, tradition
> - Eating rice = being Japanese

---

## Fasting and Food Avoidance

### Not Eating = Symbolic

**Religious Fasting:**
- Ramadan (Islam): daylight fasting
- Lent (Christianity): limited foods
- Yom Kippur (Judaism): complete fast
- Buddhist monks: no food after noon

**Functions:**
- Discipline, piety
- Solidarity (communal fasting)
- Purification
- Spiritual focus (transcend body)

**Gender and Fasting:**

**Caroline Bynum, "Holy Feast and Holy Fast":**
- Medieval women mystics
- Extreme fasting (anorexia mirabilis)
- Control, piety
- Eucharist = food
- Gendered religiosity

**Contemporary Anorexia:**
- Not just medical
- Cultural meanings
- Control, purity, femininity
- Western body ideals

## Cuisine and National Identity

### Anderson's "Imagined Communities"

**National Cuisines:**
- Construct national identity
- "French cuisine," "Italian cuisine"
- Homogenize regional diversity
- Invented traditions

**Cookbooks:**
- Define national food
- Standardize
- Create boundaries

### Examples

> **Italian Cuisine**
>
> - "Italian food" recent (unification 1861)
> - Regional: Tuscan ≠ Sicilian ≠ Venetian
> - Pasta as "Italian" (19th-20th century)
> - Diaspora (US) reinforced
> - Imagined unity

> **Indian Cuisine**
>
> - British invention ("curry")
> - Enormous diversity (regional, religious, caste)
> - "Indian restaurant" = homogenized
> - Chicken tikka masala (British creation)

> **Chinese Cuisine**
>
> - Regional cuisines (Cantonese, Sichuan, etc.)
> - "Chinese food" in West ≠ China
> - Fortune cookies (US invention)
> - Adapts to local tastes

**Authenticity Debates:**
- What's "real" Chinese, Italian, etc.?
- Essentialism
- Cuisine always changing, hybrid

---

## Food and Class

### Distinction (Bourdieu)

**Pierre Bourdieu, "Distinction" (1979):**

**Taste = Class:**
- Food preferences mark class
- Not individual—socially learned
- "Habitus" (embodied class)

**Working Class:**
- Hearty, filling
- Quantity
- "Taste of necessity"

**Middle Class:**
- Health-conscious
- Organic, whole foods
- Knowledge (exotic cuisines)

**Upper Class:**
- Fine dining, rare
- Quality, refinement
- Aesthetic

**Cultural Capital:**
- Knowing what to eat, how
- Distinction through taste
- Class reproduction

**Critique:**
- Too deterministic?
- But insight: food = class marker

---

## Globalization and Food

### Homogenization vs. Diversity

**McDonald's:**
- Symbol of globalization
- Standardization
- "McDonaldization" (Ritzer)

**But:**
- Local adaptations
- McPaneer (India)
- Teriyaki burger (Japan)
- "Glocalization"

**James Watson, "Golden Arches East":**
- McDonald's in Asia
- Adapted, localized
- Meanings differ
- Not simple Americanization

### Slow Food Movement

**Founded 1980s (Italy):**
- Resist fast food
- Local, traditional, sustainable
- Pleasure, quality
- Political

**Critique:**
- Elitist (expensive)
- Romanticizes past
- But: challenges industrial food

---

## Food Justice and Politics

### Access and Inequality

**Food Deserts:**
- Urban areas without fresh food
- Fast food, convenience stores
- Poverty, racism
- Health impacts

**Food Sovereignty:**
- Indigenous, peasant movements
- Control over food systems
- Resist corporate agriculture
- Via Campesina

**Anthropology:**
- Study food inequality
- Activism
- Applied work

---

## GMOs and "Frankenfood"

### Biosociality

**Genetically Modified Organisms:**
- Scientific, economic, political
- Also symbolic

**Meanings:**
- US: mostly accepted (unlabeled)
- Europe: strongly opposed ("Frankenfood")
- Purity, nature, risk

**Not Just Science:**
- Values, identity, trust
- Precautionary principle
- What counts as "natural"?

**Glenn Stone:**
- Bt cotton (India)
- Economic, ecological
- Farmer suicides (complex causes)
- Symbolic battles

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are food preferences "just taste" or deeply cultural?

**Question 2:** Should we respect all food traditions, or criticize some (animal welfare)?

**Question 3:** Is veganism culturally specific (Western privilege) or universal ethics?

**Question 4:** Can "authentic" cuisine exist, or is all cuisine hybrid?

**Question 5:** What does your food say about your identity?

**Remember:** Food is never just nutrition—it's symbol, identity, power, sociality. Lévi-Strauss: cooking transforms nature to culture. Douglas: meals have grammar, purity rules. Mintz: sugar links slavery, capitalism, working-class consumption. Harris: taboos have material reasons. Food taboos define boundaries (dog meat, insects, pork). Commensality creates bonds—who eats together matters. Fasting is symbolic discipline. National cuisines are invented traditions. Class marks taste (Bourdieu). Globalization creates hybrids. Food justice reveals inequality. Understanding food culture reveals how everyday practices carry profound meanings—we eat identities, histories, relationships.
