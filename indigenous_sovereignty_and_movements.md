- Demands: Self-determination, treaty rights, end termination

**Key Events:**

**Alcatraz Occupation (1969-1971):**
- "Indians of All Tribes" occupy Alcatraz Island (San Francisco Bay)
- Abandoned federal prison
- Claim: Treaty right (unused federal land returns to tribes)
- 19 months (occupation)
- Media attention (national, international)
- Symbolic (indigenous visibility)

**Trail of Broken Treaties (1972):**
- Caravan to Washington DC
- 20-Point Position Paper (demands)
  - Restore treaty-making
  - Sovereignty recognition
  - Land return
- Occupation of Bureau of Indian Affairs building

**Impact:**
- Awareness (indigenous issues, national consciousness)
- Policy changes (some)
- Divisions (within indigenous communities, tactics debated)

---

## Self-Determination Era

### US Policy Shifts

**Termination Era (1950s-1960s):**
- Goal: End federal recognition (tribes), assimilate
- Disastrous (poverty, loss of services)
- Ended 1960s

**Self-Determination (1970s+):**
- Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (1975)
- Tribes: More control (programs, services)
- Federal trust responsibility (maintained)

**Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA, 1978):**
- Stop removal of indigenous children (foster care, adoption)
- Preference: Placement with family, tribe
- Response to forced removals (1950s-1970s, disproportionate)

**American Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978):**
- Protect indigenous religious practices
- Access to sacred sites (on public lands)

---

## Sovereignty

### Nation-to-Nation

**What Is Sovereignty?**
- Self-governance
- Political authority (internal)
- Recognition (external)

**Tribal Sovereignty (US):**
- **Domestic dependent nations** (Chief Justice Marshall, 1831)
  - Sovereign (but not fully)
  - Federal government: Trust responsibility
  - States: Limited jurisdiction (reservations)

**Powers:**
- Govern internal affairs
- Courts (tribal), law enforcement
- Tax (members, on reservations)
- Economic development
- Natural resource management

**Limitations:**
- Not fully independent (federal government authority)
- Plenary power (Congress can override)
- Constraints (legal, economic)

---

## Land and Treaty Rights

### Ongoing Struggles

**Land Claims:**
- Return of stolen/illegally taken land
- Compensation

**Examples:**

**Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA, 1971):**
- Extinguished aboriginal title (Alaska)
- In exchange: $1 billion, 44 million acres
- Native corporations (created, manage land/money)
- Controversial (privatization, corporate model)

**Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act (1980):**
- Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Maliseet (Maine)
- Claimed 2/3 of Maine (treaty violations)
- Settlement: $81.5 million, 300,000 acres
- Largest land claim settlement (eastern US)

**Black Hills (Lakota):**
- Sacred (Lakota)
- Illegally taken (1877, after gold discovered)
- Supreme Court ruled illegal taking (1980)
- Awarded compensation ($100+ million, with interest now $1+ billion)
- **Lakota refused** (want land back, not money)
- "The Black Hills are not for sale"

**Fishing Rights (Northwest):**
- Treaties (1850s): Reserved fishing rights
- States: Ignored, restricted
- **United States v. Washington (1974, "Boldt Decision"):**
  - Affirmed treaty rights
  - 50% of salmon harvest (tribes)
  - Violent backlash (non-indigenous fishers)
  - Upheld (still contested)

---

## Economic Development

### Casinos and Beyond

**Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (1988):**
- Tribes: Operate casinos (reservations)
- Some: Extremely profitable (Connecticut: Foxwoods, Mohegan Sun)
- Some: Modest income
- Many: No casino (remote, small)

**Revenue:**
- Tribal government (fund services, health, education, housing)
- Per capita payments (some tribes, not all)

**Debates:**
- Positive: Economic development, jobs, sovereignty (financial)
- Negative: Dependency, social problems (gambling addiction), not all benefit equally

**Other Economic Development:**
- Natural resources (oil, gas, timber, mining)
- Tourism (culture, heritage)
- Renewable energy (solar, wind)
- Arts, crafts

---

## Repatriation

### NAGPRA

- Museums, federal agencies → Tribes

**Impact:**

---

## Language Revitalization
