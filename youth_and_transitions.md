# Youth and Transitions: Adolescence, Initiation, and Coming of Age

---

## Is Adolescence Universal?

### The Debate

**G. Stanley Hall (1904):**
- "Adolescence" = storm and stress
- Biological, universal
- Hormones, turmoil

**Margaret Mead (1928):**
- "Coming of Age in Samoa"
- **Challenged Hall**
- Samoa: peaceful adolescence
- Culture, not biology

**Contemporary View:**
- Puberty universal (biological)
- Adolescence cultural (social category)
- "Teenager" recent invention

**David Bakan:**
- Adolescence emerged with:
  - Extended schooling
  - Delayed marriage
  - Industrial economy

## Initiation Rites

### Van Gennep's Structure

**"Rites of Passage" (1909):**

**Three Phases:**
1. **Separation** - Leave old status
2. **Transition (Liminality)** - Betwixt and between
3. **Incorporation** - Enter new status

**Applied to:**
- Birth, puberty, marriage, death
- Status changes

### Victor Turner: Liminality

**Elaborated Van Gennep:**
- Liminal period powerful
- Ambiguous, dangerous
- "Neither here nor there"
- Communitas (anti-structure)
- Transformation

**Remember:** Adolescence is culturally variable—Mead challenged Hall's universalism. Initiation rites mark transitions (Van Gennep three phases, Turner liminality). Male initiation often violent, creates masculinity (Ndembu, Sambia, Maasai). Female initiation celebrates fertility, prepares for marriage (Bemba chisungu, Apache sunrise). Age-grade systems (East Africa). Youth cultures as resistance (Hebdige punks, hip hop). Digital youth (boyd, Ito) not destroyed by technology. Modern US lacks clear rituals. Gangs offer belonging amid marginalization (Bourgois, Venkatesh). Military as initiation. Migrant youth navigate cultures. Student activism. Delayed adulthood/emerging adulthood (Arnett). Waithood in Global South (unemployment). Youth have agency. Understanding youth anthropology reveals how societies manage transition to adulthood—rituals, cultures, politics of youth always cultural, generational, contested.
