# Digital Anthropology: Internet, Social Media, and Digital Cultures

---

## Digital Anthropology: Overview

### Defining the Field

**Digital Anthropology:**
- Study of digital technologies and their social/cultural effects
- How people use, create meaning through digital media
- Online and offline (not separate worlds, entangled)

**Key Questions:**
- How does digital transform social life?
- What is specific to digital vs. continuous with prior media?
- Who has access, who is excluded? (digital divide)
- Power, surveillance, capitalism online

**NOT:**
- "Virtual" = separate from "real" (outdated binary)
- Cyberspace = separate place (integrated into everyday life)

---

## Early Internet Ethnography

### Pioneers

**Sherry Turkle:**
- *The Second Self* (1984)
  - Computers and identity
  - Early personal computing
- *Life on the Screen* (1995)
  - Internet, MUDs (multi-user dungeons), identity play
  - Online = experiment with identity (gender, persona)
  - Cyberspace as "identity workshop"

**Critique:**
- Assumed online/offline separation (no longer holds)
- BUT: Pioneering, showed internet = cultural, not just technical

### Social Media and Teens

**"Why Youth ❤ Social Network Sites"** (2007, article):
- Teens, MySpace, Facebook (early days)

**Arguments:**
- Teens use social media for: Connection, identity, sociality
- NOT addicted or damaged (moral panic overblown)
- Continuity (teens always sought peer spaces, now digital)
- **Networked publics:** Online spaces (persistent, searchable, replicable, scalable)

**It's Complicated** (2014):
- Teen social media (updated)
- Privacy (teens DO care, but different strategies)
  - Social privacy (from parents, adults, not corporations)
  - "Privacy through obscurity" (coded language, inside jokes)
- Inequality (digital divide, not all teens equal access)

## Alice Marwick

### Status Update

**Status Update** (2013):
- Silicon Valley, tech culture, Twitter

**Arguments:**
- **Edited self:** Online identity = curated, performed
- **Micro-celebrity:** Social media users adopt celebrity practices
  - Self-branding, followers, engagement metrics
  - Aspirational labor (hope for fame, influence)
- **Attention economy:** Attention = currency
  - Likes, retweets, followers = status
- **Lifestreaming:** Constant documentation, sharing
- **Context collapse:** Multiple audiences (family, friends, colleagues) see same posts
  - Impossible to manage impressions (Goffman)

**Silicon Valley:**
- Tech elites (meritocracy ideology, but reproduces inequality)
- Wealth inequality (startup founders vs. workers)

### Anonymous and Hackers

**Coding Freedom** (2013):
- Free and open-source software (FOSS) developers
- Ethics, collaboration, politics
- Hacking = craft, creativity, politics (not just crime)

**Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy** (2014):
- Anonymous (hacktivist collective)
- Origins (4chan, lulz, trolling)
- Evolution (political, activism, operations)
  - OpTunisia, OpEgypt (Arab Spring support)
  - OpPayback (pro-WikiLeaks)
- Distributed (no leaders, fluid membership)
- "We are Anonymous. We are Legion."

**Anthropology:**
- Participant observation (IRC channels, forums)
- Ethics (researching illegal activity)
- Shows: Hackers = diverse, not monolithic

---

## Heather Horst and Daniel Miller

### Digital Anthropology (Textbook)

**Digital Anthropology** (2012, edited volume):
- Programmatic statement

**Key Arguments:**
- Digital ≠ virtual (materiality matters, devices, infrastructure)
- Continuity AND change (digital transforms, but also amplifies existing)
- Inequality (digital reproduces offline inequalities)
- Culture-specific (how digital used varies by context)

**Examples:**
- Philippines (texting, class, kinship)
- Jamaica (mobile phones, relationships)
- Trinidad (Facebook, culture-specific uses)

---

## Daniel Miller

### Social Media Studies

**Tales from Facebook** (2011):
- Trinidad, Facebook adoption

**Why We Post** (2016, project):
- 9-country comparative study (social media worldwide)
- Brazil, Chile, China, England, India, Italy, Trinidad, Turkey, industrial England

**Findings:**
- Social media = culturally variable (not universal)
- Scalable sociality (manage different relationship intensities)
- Polymedia (multiple platforms, strategic use)
  - WhatsApp (family, close), Facebook (broader), Instagram (visual)
- Visibility (managing who sees what)

**How the World Changed Social Media** (2016):
- Social media didn't change world uniformly
- World shaped social media (local uses, appropriations)

---

## Tom Boellstorff

### Second Life

**Coming of Age in Second Life** (2008):
- Second Life (virtual world, 3D avatars)
- Ethnography (participant observation, avatar ethnographer)

**Argument:**
- Virtual worlds = "real" (consequential, meaningful)
- Culture (emerges online, not just reflection of offline)
- Place-making (virtual spaces = places, attachments)
- Identity (avatar ≠ mask, authentic self-expression)

**Method:**
- 2 years fieldwork (entirely in Second Life)
- No offline interviews (methodological choice, virtual as site)

**Critique:**
- Second Life declined (less relevant now)
- BUT: Methodological innovation, virtual worlds scholarship

---

## Memes and Participatory Culture

### Henry Jenkins

**Convergence Culture** (2006):
- Media convergence (old + new media)
- Participatory culture (fans, users create content)
- Collective intelligence

**Examples:**
- Harry Potter fans (fan fiction, activism)
- Survivor spoilers (collective investigation)

**Anthropology:**
- Not anthropologist, but influential
- Participatory culture = anthropological (communities, practices, meanings)

---

## Crystal Abidin

### Influencers

**Internet Celebrity** (2018):
- Influencers, micro-celebrities, Singapore/Asia focus

**Arguments:**
- Influencer = profession (labor, not just narcissism)
- Authenticity paradox (must seem authentic, but curated)
- Calibrated amateurism (professional polish, amateur aesthetics)
- Relatability (ordinariness, accessibility)

**Platforms:**
- Instagram, YouTube, TikTok (platform-specific affordances)

---

## Algorithms and Platforms

### Tarleton Gillespie

**"The Politics of 'Platforms'"** (2010, article):
- Platform (political term, not just technical)
- Platforms claim neutrality (but shape, curate, moderate)

**Custodians of the Internet** (2018):
- Content moderation (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter)
- Decisions (what's allowed, removed)
- Power (platforms = gatekeepers, editors)

---

## Nick Seaver

### Algorithmic Culture

**"Algorithms as culture"** (2017, article):
- Algorithms (Netflix recommendations, Spotify playlists)

**Argument:**
- Algorithms ≠ neutral, technical
- Cultural (made by people, encode values, shape culture)
- "Captivating algorithms" (designed to engage, hook)

**Ethnography:**
- Music recommendation engineers (interviewed, observed)
- Algorithms = human-made, contestable

---

## Safiya Noble

### Algorithms of Oppression

**Algorithms of Oppression** (2018):
- Google search, racism, sexism

**Argument:**
- Search algorithms (biased, not neutral)
- Example: "Black girls" search (returned pornography, stereotypes)
- Structural (reflects and reproduces societal racism, sexism)
- Power (Google shapes knowledge, access)

**Implications:**
- Algorithmic accountability (who is responsible?)
- Regulation (should algorithms be regulated?)

---

## Ruha Benjamin

### Race After Technology

**Race After Technology** (2019):
- Technology and racial inequality
- "New Jim Code" (algorithms, AI, reproduce racism)

**Examples:**
- Facial recognition (less accurate on darker skin, Black faces)
- Predictive policing (targets Black neighborhoods)
- Risk assessment (criminal justice, biased)
- Healthcare algorithms (race corrections, structural racism)

**Argument:**
- Technology NOT neutral (encodes and amplifies inequality)
- "Default settings" (often exclude, harm marginalized)
- Imagination (need to imagine otherwise, abolitionist tech)

---

## Surveillance

### danah boyd and Kate Crawford

**"Critical Questions for Big Data"** (2012, article):
- Big data (promises, perils)

**Critiques:**
- Bigger ≠ better (data quality, representativeness)
- Context collapse (data divorced from context)
- Ethics (informed consent, privacy)
- Power (who collects, controls, benefits)

---

## Shoshana Zuboff

### Surveillance Capitalism

**The Age of Surveillance Capitalism** (2019):
- Google, Facebook, business model

**Argument:**
- Surveillance capitalism (extract behavioral data, predict, modify behavior)
- Behavioral surplus (data harvested, commodified)
- Prediction products (sold to advertisers, insurers, others)
- Instrumentarianism (power to shape behavior at scale)

**Anthropology:**
- Not anthropologist, but influential
- Ethnographic examples (how tech companies operate)

---

## Digital Methods

### Doing Ethnography Online

**Challenges:**
- Ephemerality (content deleted, platforms change)
- Scale (millions of users, posts)
- Ethics (public vs. private, informed consent)
- Access (platforms restrict researchers)

**Strategies:**
- Multi-sited (follow people, content across platforms)
- Screenshots, archives (preserve data)
- Combining online/offline (integrated)
- Digital ethnography (observation, participation online)

**Examples:**
- Observing forums, Discord, Reddit
- Following hashtags, memes
- Interviewing via video call
- Analyzing platform affordances

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is online life "real" life?

**Question 2:** Are algorithms neutral or political?

**Question 3:** Does social media connect or isolate people?

**Question 4:** Who owns our data and should they?

**Question 5:** Can digital anthropology still be anthropology?
