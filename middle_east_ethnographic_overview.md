# Middle East Ethnography: Societies, Cultures, and Transformations

---

## Introduction: Defining and Redefining the Middle East

**What is the "Middle East"?**

The term itself is Eurocentric—"middle" and "east" from whose perspective?

**Geographic Scope (varies by definition):**
- Core: Arabian Peninsula, Levant, Iraq, Iran, Egypt
- Often includes: Turkey, North Africa (Maghreb)
- Sometimes: Afghanistan, Pakistan
- Overlaps with: "Arab World," "Islamic World," "MENA" (Middle East North Africa)

**Problems with the Term:**
- Homogenizes vast diversity
- Imposes external categorization
- Colonial origins (British perspective)

**Yet:** Useful for organizing knowledge about a region with:
- Shared historical connections (ancient empires, Islamic expansion)
- Language families (Arabic, Turkish, Persian)
- Predominant religion (Islam, but also Christianity, Judaism, others)
- Political dynamics (colonialism, oil, conflicts)

**Anthropological Approach:**
- Recognize diversity within
- Avoid Orientalism (Edward Said's critique: West constructs "Orient" as exotic Other)
- Focus on specific societies, not generalized "Middle East"

---

## Historical Context: Why Anthropology Came Late

**Early Focus:**
- Archaeologists studied ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia
- Biblical scholars studied "Holy Land"
- Travelers wrote accounts (often Orientalist)

**Anthropology Delayed:**
- Cultural anthropology focused on "primitives" (colonized peoples)
- Middle East: "civilized," literate, Islamic empires
- Didn't fit "primitive society" model

**Shift (Mid-20th century):**
- Post-WWII: Anthropologists turn to peasant societies, complex societies
- Middle East becomes field site
- Focus: Tribes, villages, urban quarters, kinship, honor, Islam

**Contemporary:**
- Middle East anthropology robust
- BUT: Challenges (war, access restrictions, politics)

## Key Themes in Middle East Ethnography

### 1. Segmentary Lineage Systems

**Bedouin:**
- Pastoral nomads (camels, sheep, goats)
- Arabian Peninsula, Sinai, North Africa

**E.E. Evans-Pritchard:**
- Studied Cyrenaican Bedouin (Libya, 1940s)
- Segmentary lineage: Nested patrilineal groups
  - Individual → Family → Lineage → Clan → Tribe
  - "Me against my brother, my brother and me against our cousin, my cousin and I against the stranger"
  - Alliances shift by context

**Function:**
- No centralized authority
- Conflict resolution through lineage support
- Flexibility (groups merge/split)

**Critique:**
- Overly structural, ahistorical
- Ignored individuals, agency
- Romanticized tribal autonomy (in reality, states, markets influence)

**Other Examples:**
- Rwala Bedouin (Alois Musil, William Lancaster)
- Bakhtiari (Iran, Fredrik Barth—more on him below)

### 2. Honor and Shame

**Mediterranean Anthropology (1960s-70s):**
- Claimed "honor-shame" complex defines Mediterranean (including Middle East)

**Honor (Male):**
- Reputation, bravery, hospitality
- Protect family, especially women's sexual purity
- Face (public standing)

**Shame (Female):**
- Modesty, sexual purity
- Women's behavior reflects on men's honor

**Mechanisms:**
- Veiling, seclusion
- Endogamy (cousin marriage maintains honor within family)
- Revenge (restore honor through retaliation)

**Example:**
- Vendetta (blood feud): Murder requires revenge or payment (diya, blood money)

**Critique:**
- Oversimplifies (not all Middle East societies fit)
- Orientalist (emphasizes "backward" practices)
- Ignores women's agency
- Honor/shame exist but aren't unique to region

**Abu-Lughod:**
- *Veiled Sentiments* (1986), Awlad 'Ali Bedouin (Egypt)
- Shows: Honor/shame are ideologies, but women have agency, poetry expresses forbidden emotions

### 3. Cousin Marriage and Kinship

**Parallel Cousin Marriage:**
- FBD (father's brother's daughter) marriage preferred in many Arab societies
- Unusual (most societies prefer exogamy)

**Functions (Debated):**
- Keep property in family
- Maintain lineage unity
- Women safer with close kin
- BUT: Not universal, preferences vs. practice differ

**Patriliny:**
- Descent through father
- Common in Middle East
- BUT: Women's roles more complex than simple patriarchy

**Women's Networks:**
- Behind-the-scenes power
- Control of domestic space
- Arrange marriages
- Influence decisions

### 4. Islam and Practice

**Islam = Diverse:**
- Sunni (majority, ~85-90% of Muslims)
- Shia (10-15%, majority in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain)
- Sects, schools of law (madhabs)
- Sufism (mystical Islam)
- Folk practices (saint veneration, amulets, magic)

**Anthropological Study:**
- How is Islam practiced (not just theology)?
- Variation across contexts
- Intersection with gender, class, ethnicity

**Clifford Geertz:**
- *Islam Observed* (1968)
- Morocco vs. Indonesia
- Same religion, different expressions

**Talal Asad:**
- Critique: "Islam" not a fixed essence
- Product of power, history, interpretation

**Example: Women and Mosques:**
- Egypt: Women increasingly attend mosque study groups
- Saba Mahmood (*Politics of Piety*, 2005): Women cultivating piety, not simply oppressed

### 5. Tribe, Village, City

**Tribes:**
- Pastoralists (Bedouin, Bakhtiari, Qashqai)
- Segmentary lineage (classic model)
- Relationship to state (tax evasion, autonomy, rebellion, incorporation)

**Villages:**
- Peasant agriculturalists
- Landlord/peasant relations
- Kinship, patronage
- "Corporate communities" (Eric Wolf)

**Cities:**
- Urban quarters (neighborhoods often kin-based, occupation-based)
- Bazaars, guilds
- Patron-client networks
- Cosmopolitan, multiethnic

**Interconnection:**
- Tribes/villages/cities not isolated
- Trade, migration, political alliances

## Case Studies: Deep Ethnographic Examples

### The Awlad 'Ali Bedouin (Lila Abu-Lughod)

**Location:** Western Desert, Egypt

**Work:** *Veiled Sentiments* (1986), *Writing Women's Worlds* (1993)

**Key Findings:**

**Honor and Modesty:**
- Public ideology: Men honor, women modesty
- Women veil, defer to men publicly

**But Poetry:**
- Women (and men) recite ghinnawas (oral poetry)
- Express vulnerability, longing, love—forbidden in public honor code
- Poetry = "veiled sentiments" (hidden emotions)

**Agency:**
- Women not passive victims
- Navigate constraints
- Resist, subvert

**Critique of Anthropology:**
- Abu-Lughod: Writing about "other" perpetuates power dynamics
- Reflexivity essential

### The Basseri (Fredrik Barth)

**Location:** Iran

**Work:** *Nomads of South Persia* (1961)

**Key Findings:**

**Transactionalism:**
- Individuals make choices to maximize resources
- NOT simply following cultural rules

**Flexibility:**
- Basseri adapt strategies (pasture, trade, marriage)
- Ecology, politics, economics all factor

**Ethnic Boundaries:**
- Basseri identity maintained through distinction from sedentary people
- Boundaries, not "content," define ethnicity

### Moroccan Suq (Clifford Geertz)

**Location:** Sefrou, Morocco

**Work:** *Meaning and Order in Moroccan Society* (1979)

**Key Findings:**

**Bazaar Economy:**
- Information asymmetry (buyers/sellers)
- Search for trustworthy partners
- Clientelization (repeat customers)

**Interpretive Approach:**
- Thick description
- Suq as semiotic system (meanings)

## Gender in the Middle East

### Beyond Orientalist Stereotypes

**Stereotype:**
- Middle Eastern women oppressed, passive, victims
- Islam inherently misogynist

**Reality:**

### Women's Worlds

**Lila Abu-Lughod, Suad Joseph, Deniz Kandiyoti, others:**
- Document women's lives
- Behind the veil: women's spaces, networks, power
- Critique Western feminism (imposing universal standards)

### Piety Movements

**Saba Mahmood:**
- Egyptian women's mosque movement
- Women choose piety
- Agency ≠ resistance (Western assumption)
- Cultivating virtuous self

### Women's Rights

**Variation:**
- Tunisia: progressive family code
- Saudi Arabia: guardianship system (loosening)
- Iran: contradictions (educated women, legal restrictions)
- Activism (local, transnational)

**Recent:**
- #MeToo in Middle East
- Women's driving in Saudi Arabia
- Iranian women protesting hijab mandates

## Anthropology and Ethics in the Middle East

### Orientalism (Edward Said, 1978)

**Critique:**
- Western scholarship constructed "Orient" as exotic, backward, despotic
- Justifies colonialism, domination
- Anthropology implicated

**Impact:**
- Self-reflection in Middle East anthropology
- Avoid essentializing, exoticizing
- Positionality, reflexivity

### Politics of Research

**Access:**
- Wars, authoritarianism limit fieldwork
- Surveillance, censorship

**Complicity:**
- Human Terrain System (US military program using anthropologists in Iraq, Afghanistan)
- AAA condemned
- Ethics of studying conflict zones

**Representation:**
- Whose voices? Whose interests?
- Anthropologists as Western, often privileged
- Collaborate with local scholars

---

## Key Anthropologists

- **E.E. Evans-Pritchard** (Bedouin, segmentary lineage)
- **Fredrik Barth** (Basseri, ethnic boundaries)
- **Clifford Geertz** (Morocco, interpretive anthropology)
- **Lila Abu-Lughod** (Bedouin, women, critique of Orientalism)
- **Saba Mahmood** (piety movement, Egypt)
- **Suad Joseph** (Lebanon, patriarchy, connectivity)
- **Talal Asad** (Islam, secularism, power)
- **Julie Peteet** (Palestinians, violence)
- **Deniz Kandiyoti** (Turkey, gender)
- **Dawn Chatty** (refugees, Bedouin)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can anthropology escape Orientalism, or is the Middle East always the "Other" for Western scholars?

**Question 2:** How do we study women's agency without imposing Western feminist frameworks?

**Question 3:** Is parallel cousin marriage "backward," or is that judgment ethnocentric?

**Question 4:** Should anthropologists work in war zones (risk complicity with military, but also document suffering)?

**Question 5:** How has oil transformed Middle East societies—for better or worse?

**Remember:** Middle East = vast diversity (Arabian Peninsula, Levant, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Turkey, North Africa). Anthropology late (focused on "primitives," Middle East "civilized"). Key themes: segmentary lineage (Bedouin, Evans-Pritchard), honor/shame complex (debated, Abu-Lughod critique), cousin marriage (FBD preference), Islam diverse (practice vs. theology, Saba Mahmood piety), tribe/village/city interconnected. Regional: Saudi Arabia Bedouin/oil wealth/women's rights, Levant conflict (Palestinians, Syria), Iraq/Iran Shia/Kurds/Barth ethnic boundaries, Egypt urban/rural/Copts/Islamism, Turkey Kurds/secularism/Islamist turn, North Africa Berber/Arab. Gender: beyond stereotypes, women's agency, piety movements. Conflict: wars, refugees millions. Oil transformed Gulf. Orientalism (Said) critique anthropology, ethics in conflict zones. Anthropologists: Evans-Pritchard, Barth, Geertz, Abu-Lughod, Mahmood, Asad, Peteet.
