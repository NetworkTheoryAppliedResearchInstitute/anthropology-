# Melanesia: Big Men, Exchange, and Diversity

---

## The Pacific: Geographic Overview

### Oceania

**Three Regions:**
- **Melanesia** ("black islands"): Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, New Caledonia
- **Polynesia** ("many islands"): Hawaii, Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, New Zealand (Māori), Easter Island, others (triangle: Hawaii-Easter Island-New Zealand)
- **Micronesia** ("small islands"): Guam, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Palau, FSM (Federated States of Micronesia), others

**Settlement:**
- Humans arrived ~50,000+ years ago (Australia, Papua New Guinea)
- Austronesian expansion (~3,500 years ago, from Taiwan → Pacific)
  - Lapita culture (pottery, distinctive)
  - Reached Remote Oceania (Polynesia/Micronesia)

**Challenges:**
- Island isolation (small populations, but connected by sea)
- Navigation (ocean voyaging, sophisticated)
- Colonial impact (European, Japanese, US)
- Climate change (especially low-lying atolls)

---

## Melanesia: Overview

### Diversity

**Geography:**
- Mostly larger islands (Papua New Guinea = largest)
- Mountainous (New Guinea)
- Tropical

**Population:**
- ~11 million (Melanesia total)
- Papua New Guinea: ~9 million (largest)

**Linguistic Diversity:**
- **Papua New Guinea: ~840 languages** (most linguistically diverse country)
  - ~12% of world's languages, <0.1% world population
- Papuan languages (hundreds, not related to each other necessarily)
- Austronesian languages (coastal areas)

**Cultural Diversity:**
- Hundreds of distinct cultures
- Village-based (mostly)
- Egalitarian (generally, big man systems)

---

## Papua New Guinea (PNG)

### Highlands and Lowlands

**Geography:**
- Mountainous (highlands, isolated valleys)
- Coastal lowlands
- Islands (offshore)

**Contact:**
- Highlands: Unknown to Europeans until 1930s (first contact)
  - Dense populations (unexpected by colonizers)
- Coastal areas: Earlier contact (19th C)

**Subsistence:**
- Horticulture (sweet potato highlands, sago/taro lowlands)
- Pigs (central, prestige, exchange)
- Hunting, gathering (supplemental)

---

## Big Men

### Leadership Without Heredity

**Definition:**
- Achieved status (not inherited)
- Influence through persuasion, generosity
- Temporary (must maintain constantly)

**Characteristics:**
- **Entrepreneurial** (organizes exchanges, feasts)
- **Oratory** (persuasive speech)
- **Generosity** (gives away wealth)
- **Multiple wives** (often, labor for gardens/pigs)
- **No coercive power** (can't command, only persuade)

**Contrast:**
- **Chiefs** (Polynesia): Inherited, coercive power, permanent
- Big men: Achieved, persuasive, temporary

**Marshall Sahlins:**
- *"Poor Man, Rich Man, Big-Man, Chief"* (1963)
  - Influential essay
  - Melanesia (big men) vs. Polynesia (chiefs)
  - Political economy (exchange, accumulation, redistribution)

---

## The Moka Exchange

### Highlands Gift-Giving

**Mount Hagen (PNG Highlands):**
- Studied by Andrew and Marilyn Strathern (1960s+)

**Moka:**
- Ceremonial exchange (competitive gift-giving)
- Pigs, pearl shells (valuables)
- Goal: Give MORE than received
  - Outdo partner (prestige)
  - Obligates return (larger)

**Process:**
- Build up wealth (years)
- Big moka ceremony (hundreds/thousands of pigs, shells)
- Public display (prestige, status)

**Function:**
- Political (build alliances, influence)
- Economic (redistribute wealth)
- Social cohesion (links groups)

**Big Man:**
- Organizes moka
- Prestige depends on generosity (giving away, not accumulating)

**Andrew Strathern:**
- *The Rope of Moka* (1971)
- Extensive ethnography (decades, return visits)

**Documentary:**
- *Ongka's Big Moka* (1974, Granada TV)
  - Follows Ongka (big man) preparing for moka
  - Classic ethnographic film

---

## Warfare

### Endemic

**Tribal Warfare:**
- Between groups (clans, tribes)
- Revenge (reciprocal killings)
- Territory, resources, women

**Pre-Colonial:**
- Common (most areas)
- Ritualized (some groups, rules)
- Deadly (stone axes, arrows, spears)

**Maring (PNG):**
- **Roy Rappaport:** *Pigs for the Ancestors* (1968)
  - Ecological anthropology
  - Ritual cycle (pig feasts, warfare, fallow)
  - **Kaiko** (pig festival)
  - Warfare regulated by ecology (pig herds, gardens)
  - Controversial (functionalist, environmental determinism?)

**Colonial Pacification:**
- Australian administration (PNG, pre-independence)
- Suppressed warfare ("law and order")

**Post-Independence:**
- Tribal fighting resumed (some areas)
- Modern weapons (guns, more deadly)

---

## Cargo Cults

### Millenarian Movements

**Definition:**
- Religious/political movements (Melanesia, 20th C)
- Expectation: Ancestors/gods will send "cargo" (European goods)
- Ritual imitation (airstrips, radio antennas, marching)

**Context:**
- Colonial encounter (inequality, Europeans had wealth/goods)
- WWII (massive influx of cargo, military bases)
- Confusion, inequality (why do Europeans have cargo, not us?)

**Explanation:**
- Ritual causation (misunderstanding? or creative response?)
- Europeans seen as having secret knowledge (rituals to get cargo)
- Imitate Europeans (to get cargo)

**Famous Examples:**

**John Frum Movement (Vanuatu):**
- 1930s+
- John Frum (mysterious figure, American? spirit?)
- Prophecy: Return with cargo
- Still active (followers today)

**Johnson Cult (New Hanover, PNG):**
- 1960s
- Belief: Lyndon B. Johnson (US president) would deliver cargo
- Collected money to "buy" Johnson (make him leader instead of Australian administration)

**Anthropological Debates:**

**Peter Worsley:**
- *The Trumpet Shall Sound* (1957)
  - Cargo cults = political resistance (anti-colonial)
  - Not just "irrational" (rational response to inequality)

**Critiques:**
- "Cargo cult" = derogatory term? (implies irrationality)
- Eurocentrism (assumes Western rationality)
- Reductionist (lumps diverse movements together)

**Contemporary Usage:**
- "Cargo cult" = metaphor (superficial imitation)
  - Economics, development (pejorative)
  - Applied to non-Melanesian contexts

---

## The Kula Ring

### Trobriand Islands Exchange

**Bronislaw Malinowski:**
- Trobriand Islands (Papua New Guinea, 1915-1918)
- *Argonauts of the Western Pacific* (1922)
- Foundational ethnography (participant observation)

**Kula:**
- Inter-island exchange network (Massim region, PNG)
- Ceremonial exchange (valuables)
  - **Mwali** (shell armbands, clockwise)
  - **Soulava** (shell necklaces, counter-clockwise)
- **No barter** (valuables never kept long, always circulating)
- Partners (*kula partners*, across islands)
- Prestige (possession of famous valuables temporarily)

**Function:**
- Political (alliances across islands)
- Social (relationships, obligations)
- Economic (facilitates trade, *gimwali*, barter alongside kula)

**Malinowski's Argument:**
- **Economic anthropology** (exchange ≠ just material gain)
- Rationality (Trobrianders = rational, not "primitive")
- Social embeddedness (economy embedded in social relations)

**Theoretical Importance:**
- Influenced Marcel Mauss (*The Gift*, 1925)
- Exchange theory (reciprocity, obligation)
- Critique of economic rationality (homo economicus)

**Annette Weiner:**
- *Women of Value, Men of Renown* (1976)
  - Returned to Trobriands (1970s)
  - Critiqued Malinowski (ignored women's exchange)
  - Women's wealth (skirts, bundles)
  - Women's exchange (mortuary rituals)
  - Gender (men's kula ≠ whole story)

---

## Sorcery and Witchcraft

### Explaining Misfortune

**Belief:**
- Widespread (Melanesia)
- Sorcery (learned, intentional)
- Witchcraft (innate power, sometimes unconscious)

**Function:**
- Explain misfortune (illness, death, accidents)
- Social control (fear of accusation)

**Trobriands (Malinowski):**
- Sorcerers (*bwaga'u*)
- Flying witches (*yoyova*, female)

**Contemporary:**
- Witchcraft accusations (violence)
- PNG: Witch-killings (especially women, elderly)
  - Torture, murder (accused witches)
  - Legal reforms (2013, repealed Sorcery Act, but violence continues)

---

## Gender

### Separate Spheres

**Generally:**
- Gender complementarity (separate but interdependent)
- Men's houses (ritual, secret societies)
- Women's exclusion (some rituals)

**Menstrual Taboos:**
- Menstruation = polluting (belief, many groups)
- Segregation (menstrual huts)

**Critiques:**
- Anthropological representations (male-biased)
- Women's power (underestimated)

**Annette Weiner (see above):**
- Women's wealth, women's exchange (important)

---

## Anthropological Classics

### PNG Ethnographies

**Mead:**
- *Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies* (1935)
  - Arapesh (gentle both sexes), Mundugumor (fierce both), Tchambuli (gender reversal?)
  - Gender = cultural (not biological)
  - Critiqued (overstated, simplified)

**Bateson:**
- *Naven* (1936)
  - Iatmul (Sepik River, PNG)
  - Ritual (naven, transvestite ritual)
  - Schismogenesis (pattern of differentiation)

**Strathern:**
- *The Gender of the Gift* (1988)
  - Melanesia, gender, exchange
  - Critique of Western categories (individual, society, nature/culture)
  - "Dividual" (person = composite, relations)

---

## Independence and Contemporary Issues

### Decolonization

**PNG Independence:**
- 1975 (from Australia)
- Parliamentary democracy
- Challenges: Nation-building (extreme diversity)

**Resource Extraction:**
- Mining (gold, copper, Ok Tedi, Porgera, others)
  - Environmental destruction
  - Benefits uneven (foreign companies, local displacement)
- Oil, gas (LNG projects)
- Logging

**Bougainville:**
- Autonomous region (PNG)
- Civil war (1988-1998, over Panguna copper mine)
  - Secession attempt (Bougainville Revolutionary Army)
  - ~15,000-20,000 deaths
- Peace agreement (2001)
- Referendum (2019, 98% voted independence)
  - Status: Ongoing negotiations (not yet independent)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are big men egalitarian or just non-hereditary elites?

**Question 2:** Were cargo cults irrational or rational responses to colonialism?

**Question 3:** Did Malinowski's gender bias distort Trobriand ethnography?

**Question 4:** How do we balance cultural understanding (sorcery beliefs) with human rights (witch-killings)?

**Question 5:** Can extreme diversity (PNG, 840 languages) form a nation?
