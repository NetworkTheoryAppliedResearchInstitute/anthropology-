# Endangered Languages and Revitalization: Saving Linguistic Diversity

---

## The Crisis

### Language Extinction

**Current Rate:**
- One language dies every ~2 weeks (estimate)
- 50-90% of world's languages endangered
- By 2100: 3,000-5,000 languages may be gone

**Definition (Endangered):**
- Few speakers (declining)
- Not transmitted to children
- Restricted domains

---

## Why Languages Die

### Causes

### 1. Genocide and Forced Assimilation

**Physical Genocide:**
- Speakers killed
- Tasmania (Aboriginal languages, extinct)
- Americas (many languages lost, contact)

**Cultural Genocide:**
- Forced assimilation
- Boarding schools (Native American, Aboriginal Australian, Sami)
  - Children removed from families
  - Forbidden to speak language
  - Punished for using
  - "Kill the Indian, save the man" (US)

**Residential Schools (Canada):**
- First Nations, Inuit, Métis children
- 1880s-1996
- Trauma, language loss
- Truth and Reconciliation Commission

---

### 2. Economic Pressure

**Dominant Language = Opportunity:**
- Jobs, education, trade
- Mobility (urban migration)
- Parents choose dominant language (children's success)

**Globalization:**
- English, Mandarin, Spanish (lingua francas)
- Media, internet
- Economic necessity

---

### 3. Political Dominance

**Official Language:**
- Government, education, courts
- Minority languages marginalized

**Nationalism:**
- "One nation, one language"
- Suppress minorities

**Examples:**
- France (regional languages: Breton, Occitan, Basque)
- Turkey (Kurdish suppressed, historically)
- China (minority languages, Mandarin promoted)

---

### 4. Stigma and Shame

**Prestige:**
- Dominant language = modern, educated
- Minority language = backward, rural

**Internalized:**
- Speakers ashamed
- Don't teach children

**Example:**
- Irish (historically stigmatized under British rule)

---

### 5. Small Population

**Demographics:**
- Few speakers (vulnerable)
- Exogamy (marry out)
- No critical mass

**Island Languages:**
- Isolated, small populations
- Especially vulnerable

---

## Stages of Language Death

### Continuum

**Michael Krauss (1992):**

**Safe:**
- Learned by children
- All domains
- Large population

**Endangered:**
- Not learned by all children
- Restricted domains

**Moribund:**
- No children learning
- Only elderly speakers

**Extinct:**
- No speakers

**UNESCO Categories:**
- Safe
- Vulnerable
- Definitely endangered
- Severely endangered
- Critically endangered
- Extinct

---

## What Is Lost?

### More Than Words

**Knowledge:**
- Ecological (plant names, animal behavior)
- Traditional medicine
- Navigation, astronomy
- Oral history

**Example:**
- Amazonian languages (plant knowledge)
- Pacific Islander languages (navigation)

**Culture:**
- Worldview
- Identity
- Songs, stories, jokes
- Social cohesion

**Linguistic Diversity:**
- Data for understanding language
- Structures not found elsewhere

**Boasian Principle:**
- Each language = unique window on human cognition

---

## Documentation

### Recording Before It's Gone

**Urgent:**
- Many languages (no written record)
- Elderly speakers (last)

**Methods:**

**Audio/Video Recording:**
- Conversations, stories, songs
- Natural speech

**Dictionaries, Grammars:**
- Linguists work with speakers
- Describe structure

**Corpora:**
- Text collections (analyzed)

**Archives:**
- Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR, UK)
- Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA, US)
- Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC, Australia)

**Challenges:**
- Time (speakers aging, dying)
- Funding (limited)
- Ethics (who owns data?)

---

## Revitalization

### Bringing Languages Back

**Definition:**
- Increase speakers
- Expand domains
- Transmission to children

**Not Always Possible:**
- Requires community will
- Resources
- Speakers (if none, revival not revitalization)

---

## Success Stories

### Hebrew

**Context:**
- Ancient language (Biblical, liturgical)
- Not spoken (daily) for ~2,000 years
- Jewish diaspora

**Revival:**
- **Eliezer Ben-Yehuda** (1858-1922)
  - "Father of Modern Hebrew"
  - Raised son (first native speaker, modern era)
  - Created new vocabulary (modern concepts)
- Zionist movement (identity)
- Israel (1948, official language)

**Result:**
- ~9 million speakers today
- Native language (children)
- **Most successful revival ever**

**Unique Circumstances:**
- Ideology (nationalism)
- Liturgical knowledge (base)
- Immigration (speakers from diverse backgrounds, common language needed)

---

### Māori (New Zealand)

**Context:**
- ~1 million Māori (population)
- Language declining (1970s)
- ~70,000 speakers today (increasing)

**Revitalization:**

**Te Kōhanga Reo ("Language Nests"):**
- Immersion preschools (1982+)
- Elders, children
- Māori-only environment

**Kura Kaupapa Māori:**
- Māori-medium schools

**Te Reo Māori (Official Language, 1987):**
- Government support
- Media (TV, radio)

**Results:**
- Speakers increasing
- Younger generation learning
- Still endangered (but improving)

---

### Hawaiian

**Context:**
- ~2,000 native speakers (1980s, elderly)
- Banned in schools (historically)

**Revitalization:**

**'Aha Pūnana Leo ("Language Nests"):**
- Immersion preschools (inspired by Māori)
- 1984+

**Immersion Schools:**
- K-12

**University of Hawaiʻi:**
- Hawaiian-medium programs
- Graduate degrees (in Hawaiian)

**Results:**
- Thousands of new speakers
- Children learning
- Still critically endangered (but progress)

---

### Welsh (Cymraeg)

**Context:**
- Wales (UK)
- Declined (English dominance)
- ~560,000 speakers today (~19% of Wales)

**Revitalization:**

**Welsh Language Act (1993):**
- Official status (Wales)
- Government services in Welsh

**Education:**
- Welsh-medium schools (increasing)
- Bilingual education (compulsory)

**Media:**
- S4C (Welsh-language TV channel)

**Results:**
- Stabilized (no longer declining rapidly)
- Young people learning

---

### Navajo (Diné Bizaad)

**Context:**
- Largest Native American language (US)
- ~170,000 speakers
- But: declining (children not learning)

**Challenges:**
- English dominance
- Boarding school legacy (trauma)
- Economic pressure

**Efforts:**
- Immersion schools (some)
- Radio, TV (Navajo)
- Diné College (Navajo-medium courses)

**Results:**
- Mixed (still declining, but slower)
- Awareness increasing

---

### Irish (Gaeilge)

**Context:**
- Ireland (official language)
- Declined (British rule, famine, emigration)
- ~1.7 million claim knowledge (but ~170,000 daily speakers)

**Revitalization:**

**Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking regions):**
- Government support
- Subsidies

**Education:**
- Compulsory (schools)
- Gaelscoileanna (Irish-medium schools, increasing)

**Media:**
- TG4 (Irish-language TV)

**Results:**
- Symbolic success (national identity)
- Practical: limited (most learn as L2, don't use daily)
- "Irish is everyone's second language"

---

## Challenges to Revitalization

### Obstacles

**1. Critical Mass:**
- Need speakers (community)
- Difficult if very few

**2. Domains:**
- Modern life (technology, work)
- Vocabulary gaps (neologisms needed)

**3. Intergenerational Transmission:**
- Parents must speak to children
- Consistent use

**4. Motivation:**
- Why learn? (practical vs. symbolic)
- Competing demands (time)

**5. Resources:**
- Funding (schools, materials)
- Teachers (fluent)

**6. Attitudes:**
- Stigma (overcome)
- Prestige (rebuild)

**7. Political Will:**
- Government support (crucial)
- Official status, education

---

## Models of Revitalization

### Fishman's GIDS (Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale)

**Joshua Fishman (1991):**
- 8 stages (most disrupted → least)
- Interventions vary by stage

**Stage 8 (Worst):**
- Elderly speakers, isolated
- **Action:** Record, reconnect

**Stage 6 (Critical):**
- Intergenerational transmission breaking
- **Action:** Language nests, family programs

**Stage 4:**
- Formal education (literacy)
- **Action:** Schools (minority language medium)

**Stage 1 (Best):**
- National/official language
- **Action:** Maintain

**Key Insight:**
- Can't skip stages
- Must focus on transmission (first)

---

### Language Nests (Te Kōhanga Reo Model)

**Concept:**
- Immersion preschool
- Elders, children
- Minority language only
- Community-based

**Spread:**
- Māori (original)
- Hawaiian ('Aha Pūnana Leo)
- Globally (adapted)

**Success:**
- Intergenerational connection
- Natural acquisition (children)
- Community ownership

---

### Master-Apprentice Programs

**Model:**
- Pair elder (fluent) with younger learner
- Intensive, one-on-one
- Daily activities (language used naturally)

**Example:**
- California (many languages)
- Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival

**Advantages:**
- Personalized
- Small languages (few speakers)

---

## Technology

### Digital Tools

**Apps:**
- Duolingo (Irish, Hawaiian, Navajo, etc.)
- Memrise
- Limited (not fluency, but awareness)

**Online Dictionaries:**
- Accessible (smartphone)

**Social Media:**
- Facebook, Twitter (in endangered languages)
- Community building
- Informal use

**Recordings:**
- YouTube, podcasts
- Accessible (worldwide)

**Debates:**
- Technology helps? (exposure, resources)
- Or: Distraction? (screen time)
- Complement (not replace) human interaction

---

## Revival (Extinction → New Speakers)

### Dormant Languages

**Definition:**
- No native speakers (extinct)
- Revived (learned as L2)

**Hebrew (Unique Success):**
- See above

**Cornish (Kernowek):**
- Cornwall (UK)
- Extinct (~1777, last native speaker)
- Revival (20th C)
- ~500 fluent speakers today (L2)
- Enthusiasm (identity)

**Manx (Gaelg):**
- Isle of Man (UK)
- Last native speaker died (1974)
- Revival (schools)
- ~1,800 speakers (L2)

**Challenges:**
- No native speaker model (pronunciation, usage)
- Reconstructed (from records)
- Identity, not communication (often)

---

## Ethical Questions

### Debates

**1. Should We Save All Languages?**

**Yes:**
- Diversity = valuable
- Knowledge, identity
- Human right (speak heritage language)

**No? (Pragmatist View):**
- Natural process (languages always die)
- Resources (better spent elsewhere?)
- Speakers choose (agency)

**Anthropological Consensus:**
- Save as many as possible
- Community decides (not outsiders)

**2. Who Owns the Language?**
- Community (speakers)
- Linguists (documenters)?
- Tensions (data access)

**3. Revival = Authentic?**
- Hebrew: "artificial"?
- But: Authentic to speakers

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is it ethical to let languages die if speakers choose dominant languages?

**Question 2:** Can a revived language (like Hebrew) be "authentic"?

**Question 3:** Should governments fund minority language education?

**Question 4:** Is linguistic diversity as important as biodiversity?

**Question 5:** What is lost when the last speaker of a language dies?
