# Structuralism: Deep Structures of the Human Mind (1940s-1970s)

---

## The French Alternative

While British anthropologists developed functionalism and Americans explored culture and personality, French anthropology took a different path—one deeply philosophical and tied to broader intellectual currents in France.

**Claude Lévi-Strauss** (1908-2009) created **structuralism**—perhaps the most intellectually ambitious and controversial theoretical framework in 20th-century anthropology.

**The Core Claim:** Beneath the bewildering diversity of human cultures lie **universal mental structures**—deep patterns in how the human mind organizes experience. All cultural variation is surface manifestation of these underlying structures.

This was radical: cultural diversity isn't random or historically particular—it expresses universal patterns of human cognition.

## Core Principles of Structuralism

### 1. Binary Opposition

**The Foundational Idea:**

The human mind organizes experience through **binary oppositions**:
- Nature / Culture
- Raw / Cooked
- Life / Death
- Male / Female
- Sacred / Profane
- Us / Them
- Hot / Cold

**Why:**
- Binary thinking is how the mind creates meaning
- We understand things by their opposites
- All cultural systems built on these oppositions

**Example from Language:**

Saussure showed: Words don't have inherent meaning. They get meaning from **contrast** with other words:
- "Hot" means something because it's NOT "cold"
- "Man" gets meaning from NOT being "woman," "child," "animal"

Lévi-Strauss applied this to culture: Cultural categories get meaning from contrast with their opposites.

### 2. Deep Structures vs. Surface Variation

**The Claim:**
- **Surface:** Visible cultural diversity (different myths, kinship systems, rituals)
- **Deep:** Universal underlying structures (binary oppositions, transformation rules)

**Analogy to Language:**
- Thousands of languages (surface diversity)
- Universal grammar rules (deep structure)
- Different languages transform same deep structures into different surface forms

**For Culture:**
- Thousands of cultures (surface)
- Universal mental structures (deep)
- Cultures are variations on universal themes

### 3. Unconscious Structures

**Key Point:** These structures operate **unconsciously**.

- People don't know they're thinking in binary oppositions
- Cultures don't consciously follow transformation rules
- The structure is revealed through analysis, not introspection

**This is like:**
- Grammar: You speak grammatically without knowing grammatical rules
- Math: You use logical structures without formal logic training

**Implication:** Anthropologists can reveal structures that participants don't see.

### 4. The Logic of Transformation

**Structures transform** across contexts:

**Example: Nature/Culture Opposition**

Appears in many forms:
- Raw/Cooked (food processing)
- Wild/Domesticated (animals)
- Untamed/Civilized (humans)
- Natural/Artificial (objects)

Same underlying structure, different surface expressions.

## Structuralism in Action

### Kinship and Marriage Alliance

**"Elementary Structures of Kinship" (1949):**

**The Question:** Why is incest universally taboo? What patterns govern marriage rules?

**Lévi-Strauss's Answer:**

**Incest Taboo = Nature/Culture Transition:**
- **Natural:** Mate with anyone
- **Cultural:** Rule against mating with close relatives
- Incest taboo creates society by forcing exchange between groups

**Marriage as Exchange:**
- Men exchange women between groups (problematic framing, criticized by feminists)
- Creates alliances and social bonds
- Reciprocity builds society

**Elementary Structures:**
Systems with positive marriage rules (must marry specific category):
- Cross-cousin marriage (marry mother's brother's daughter or father's sister's daughter)
- Creates systematic alliance networks
- Mathematical models show how these work

**The Claim:** Kinship systems express universal structures of reciprocity and exchange. Variations follow transformation rules from deep structures.

**Critique:**
- Women as objects exchanged by men (gendered critique)
- Overly formal, abstract
- Real kinship messier than models
- But: Showed kinship systems have logical patterns

### Myth Analysis

**"Mythologiques" (4 volumes):**

Lévi-Strauss analyzed hundreds of myths from indigenous Americas, showing they're variations on common structural themes.

**Method:**

**1. Identify Binary Oppositions:**
- Life/Death
- Sky/Earth
- Raw/Cooked
- Culture/Nature
- Kin/Strangers

**2. Show How Myth Mediates Oppositions:**
Myths don't solve contradictions but transform them into manageable forms.

**Example: The Jaguar Myth (simplified):**

**Problem:** Humans are caught between nature (animals) and culture (civilization)

**Myth Structure:**
- Jaguar = wild, dangerous, natural
- Fire = cultural tool
- Jaguar gives humans fire
- But jaguar is also threat
- Myth mediates nature/culture tension through jaguar as simultaneously natural and culture-bringer

**The Point:** Myths aren't random stories. They're structured responses to universal human dilemmas (death, culture vs. nature, social order).

**Lévi-Strauss's Massive Project:**

Showed South American myths are all variations on same structures:
- Different surface stories
- Same deep structural patterns
- Myths transform into each other following rules

> **"The Raw and the Cooked" (first volume):**
>
> Cooking is cultural transformation of nature:
> - Raw = nature
> - Cooked = culture
> - Rotten = nature defeating culture
>
> Myths about cooking express anxiety about nature/culture boundary.

**Critique:**
- Brilliant but speculative
- Hard to verify or falsify
- Sometimes forced myths to fit patterns
- But: Revealed deep patterns many find convincing

### Totemism

**"The Savage Mind" (1962):**

**The Problem:** Why do societies identify with animals (totems)?

**Old Explanation:** "Primitives" confuse humans and animals, lack rational thought.

**Lévi-Strauss's Answer:**

Totemism is **logical classification system**:
- Differences between animal species (eagle vs. bear vs. salmon)
- Correspond to differences between social groups (clan A vs. clan B vs. clan C)
- Natural discontinuities model social discontinuities

**The Point:**
- "Primitive" thought is just as logical as Western thought
- Uses different materials (animals, plants, nature) but same logical operations
- Binary oppositions, classification, systematic thinking

**"Savage Mind" = "Wild Thought":**
Not inferior but untamed—thinking with concrete images rather than abstract concepts.

**Impact:** Demolished notion that "primitives" are pre-logical. Showed intellectual equality across cultures.

## Critiques of Structuralism

### 1. Ahistorical

**Critique:** Structuralism ignores history and change.

- Focuses on timeless structures
- Real cultures change, borrow, transform historically
- Structures can't explain how cultures change

**Lévi-Strauss's Response:** History is surface variation. Deep structures are constant.

**Counter-Critique:** But change matters! Can't ignore it.

### 2. Deterministic

**Critique:** If structures determine culture, where's human agency?

- People seem passive, following unconscious rules
- No room for creativity, resistance, individual choice

### 3. Unfalsifiable

**Critique:** How do you prove or disprove structural analysis?

- Analysts find patterns they're looking for
- Different analysts find different structures
- No clear test of validity
- Circular: cultures fit structures because analyst constructs structures from cultures

### 4. Eurocentric Binary Thinking

**Critique:** Binary oppositions are Western thinking, not universal.

- Many non-Western philosophies don't think in binary terms
- Buddhism: not either/or but both/and
- Imposing Western logic on other cultures

**Lévi-Strauss Assumed:** His structures are universal. But critics argue they're Western.

### 5. Ignores Power and Politics

**Critique:** Structuralism treats cultures as logical systems, ignoring power, inequality, conflict.

- Who benefits from particular structures?
- How do structures maintain domination?
- Where's resistance and change?

**Feminist Critique:** Women as objects exchanged by men treats patriarchy as natural structure rather than system of oppression.

### 6. Abstract and Remote from Experience

**Critique:** Real people don't experience structures. They experience meaning, emotion, action.

- Structuralism seems disconnected from lived reality
- Overly intellectual and formal
- Misses what matters to people

---

## What Structuralism Contributed

### 1. Demolished "Primitive Mentality"

**Showed:** Non-Western thought is equally logical and complex.

- "Savage mind" is sophisticated
- Different but not inferior
- Used same cognitive operations

**This was anti-racist intervention**, like Boas's work.

### 2. Revealed Patterns Beneath Diversity

**Showed:** Cultural diversity isn't random.

- Myths have common structures
- Kinship follows logical patterns
- Apparently bizarre practices make systematic sense

### 3. Influenced Broader Thought

**Structuralism influenced:**
- Literary criticism
- Psychology (Piaget, Lacan)
- Philosophy (Foucault, though he moved beyond structuralism)
- Semiotics

**Became major intellectual movement beyond anthropology.**

### 4. Sophisticated Comparative Method

**Provided tools for cross-cultural comparison:**
- Formal analysis
- Systematic patterns
- Rigorous comparison

### 5. Attention to Classification and Cognition

**Sparked interest in:**
- How cultures classify the world
- Cognitive anthropology
- Symbolic systems
- Language and thought

---

## After Structuralism

### Post-Structuralism (1970s-1990s)

**Critics** (especially in France) accepted structural insights but rejected:
- Fixed structures
- Binary oppositions
- Determinism

**Emphasized:**
- Fluidity and change
- Multiple meanings
- Power and discourse
- Deconstruction of oppositions

**Figures:** Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze (though they moved beyond anthropology)

### Interpretive Anthropology (Geertz)

**Rejected structuralism for:**
- Focus on meaning as people experience it
- Thick description over formal analysis
- Context and particularity over universal structures

### Practice Theory (Bourdieu)

**Combined elements of structuralism with agency:**
- Habitus: internalized structures
- But: People actively use and transform structures
- Practice mediates structure and agency

---

## Lévi-Strauss's Legacy

### What Remains:

**Attention to Symbolic Systems:**
- How cultures create meaning
- Classification and categories matter
- Symbols are systematic, not random

**Intellectual Rigor:**
- Formal analysis has place in anthropology
- Comparative method can be sophisticated
- Theory matters

**Cognitive Dimension:**
- Culture isn't just behavior—it's mental structures
- Classification systems reveal how people think

### What Was Abandoned:

**Universal Structures:**
Most anthropologists no longer seek timeless structures beneath all variation.

**Binary Oppositions:**
Rejected as Western imposition, overly rigid.

**Ahistorical Approach:**
History and change are central, not surface variation.

**Determinism:**
People actively create meaning, not just follow structures.

---

## Contemporary Relevance

**Where Structuralist Ideas Persist:**

**Cognitive Anthropology:**
- How do people categorize the world?
- Universal cognitive constraints on culture?

**Symbolic Anthropology:**
- Cultural symbols as systematic
- Meaning as structural relationships

**Digital Humanities:**
- Computational analysis of myths, folktales
- Pattern recognition in large cultural datasets

**But:** Contemporary approaches emphasize flexibility, variation, and human agency more than rigid structures.

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Do you think in binary oppositions? Can you think of examples from your own experience?

**Question 2:** Is Lévi-Strauss right that deep structures explain surface diversity, or does this ignore what matters most—history, power, individual experience?

**Question 3:** Can universal mental structures coexist with cultural relativism? Or does universalism always undermine relativism?

**Question 4:** Why was structuralism so influential if it's so problematic?

**Question 5:** What would it take to prove or disprove a structural analysis? Is this even possible?

**Later Developments:**
- Cognitive Anthropology: Continues structural interest in classification
- Practice Theory (Session 6): Synthesizes structure and agency
- Symbolic Anthropology (Session 5): Meaning without rigid structures

**Remember:** Structuralism was brilliant and flawed. Lévi-Strauss showed "primitive" thought is logical and sophisticated, demolished cultural hierarchies, and revealed patterns beneath diversity. But his universal structures seem rigid, ahistorical, and disconnected from lived experience. Contemporary anthropology keeps his attention to symbolic systems and classification while rejecting fixed, timeless structures. Culture is systematic but also flexible, historical, and created by active humans—not just expressions of unconscious mental structures.
