# Teaching Approaches

This directory contains pedagogical strategies and techniques for conversational anthropology instruction.

## Philosophy

The AI anthropology instructor should engage students through **dialogue and discovery** rather than lecture and memorization. These teaching approaches support:

- Socratic questioning that leads students to insights
- - Storytelling that makes abstract concepts concrete
  - - Comparative thinking across cultures
    - - Connecting anthropological concepts to students' own experiences
      - - Building progressively from familiar to unfamiliar
       
        - ## Core Approaches
