# Culture and Personality: The American Psychological Approach (1920s-1950s)

---

## Psychology Meets Anthropology

While British anthropologists developed functionalism, American anthropologists (Boas's students) pursued a different question:

**How does culture shape personality? How do different cultures produce different types of people?**

This was the **Culture and Personality school**—an American approach combining anthropology with psychology, particularly Freudian psychoanalysis. It asked: If culture is learned, how is it learned? How does growing up in a culture shape the mind?

**The insight:** Culture isn't just external rules people follow—it's internalized, shaping how people think, feel, and experience the world. Different cultures produce characteristically different personalities.

## The Founders and Key Figures

### Ruth Benedict (1887-1948): Patterns of Culture

**Background:**
- Boas's student at Columbia
- Came to anthropology late (after unhappy marriage, poetry career)
- Never comfortable with fieldwork but brilliant theorist and writer

**Major Work:** *Patterns of Culture* (1934)

**Core Idea: Cultures as Patterns**

Benedict argued each culture selects from the "great arc" of human possibilities, emphasizing certain values while suppressing others. Cultures have **distinctive patterns** or **configurations**—integrated ways of life with characteristic emotional tones.

> **The Nietzschean Framework:**
>
> Benedict borrowed from philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche:
> - **Apollonian:** Measured, moderate, controlled, balanced (like Greek god Apollo)
> - **Dionysian:** Ecstatic, intense, excessive, emotional (like Greek god Dionysus)

**Her Examples:**

**1. The Pueblo (Apollonian):**
- Emphasis on moderation, cooperation, group harmony
- Distrust of individual excess or assertion
- Calm, measured, avoiding extremes
- Value consensus and tradition
- Suspicious of personal power

**2. The Plains Indians (Dionysian):**
- Value individual vision quests and ecstatic experience
- Seek personal power through suffering (Sun Dance)
- Warriors gain glory through individual exploits
- Emphasis on personal achievement and honor
- Intense emotional experiences valued

**3. The Kwakiutl (Paranoid, Megalomaniac):**
- Benedict portrayed them as obsessed with status and rivalry
- Potlatch as competitive destruction
- Shame and humiliation central
- (This portrayal is now considered exaggerated and problematic)

**The Point:**
These aren't biological differences—they're cultural patterns. Pueblo children and Plains children are equally capable, but their cultures shape them toward different personality types.

**Benedict's Influence:**
- Made anthropology accessible to general readers
- Showed culture shapes personality
- Introduced configurational approach (cultures as integrated wholes)
- Influenced World War II policy (her study of Japanese culture)

**Problems:**
- Oversimplified cultures (treated them as homogeneous)
- Sometimes stereotyped
- Ignored individual variation within cultures
- Kwakiutl portrayal particularly criticized

### Margaret Mead (1901-1978): Culture and Human Development

**Background:**
- Boas's and Benedict's student
- Became anthropology's most famous public intellectual
- Used anthropology to challenge American assumptions

**Major Works:**
- *Coming of Age in Samoa* (1928)
- *Growing Up in New Guinea* (1930)
- *Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies* (1935)

**Core Questions:**
- Is adolescent turmoil universal (biological) or cultural?
- Are gender roles natural or culturally constructed?
- How does early childhood experience shape personality?

**Samoa Study (1928):**

> **The Question:** Is adolescent "storm and stress" universal?
>
> **American Assumption:** Teenagers are naturally rebellious, emotional, difficult (biological puberty causes this).
>
> **Mead's Findings in Samoa:**
> - Samoan adolescence is relatively easy and smooth
> - No major conflict with parents
> - Sexual experimentation casual and accepted
> - Gradual transition to adulthood
> - No identity crisis
>
> **Conclusion:** Adolescent turmoil is **cultural**, not biological. American teenage angst reflects American cultural tensions, not universal human nature.

**The Controversy:**

Derek Freeman (1983) attacked Mead's findings:
- Claimed she was deceived by informants
- Said Samoan adolescence is actually troubled
- Accused her of ideological bias

**The Debate:**
Anthropologists remain divided. Many defend Mead's core point (adolescence is culturally shaped) while acknowledging she may have idealized Samoa. The debate shows difficulties of ethnographic truth claims.

**Sex and Temperament (1935):**

> **Three New Guinea Societies:**
>
> **Arapesh:** Both men and women gentle, nurturing, cooperative (maternal qualities in all)
>
> **Mundugumor:** Both men and women aggressive, competitive, harsh (paternal qualities in all)
>
> **Tchambuli (Chambri):** Gender roles reversed from Western norms:
> - Women assertive, practical, dominating
> - Men artistic, gossipy, decorative
>
> **Conclusion:** Gender roles aren't natural—they're culturally constructed. Biology doesn't determine whether women are nurturing or men are aggressive.

**Mead's Legacy:**
- Demonstrated culture's power over biology in shaping gender and personality
- Made anthropology publicly visible
- Influenced feminism and parenting practices
- But: Sometimes oversimplified for popular audiences

### Edward Sapir (1884-1939): Language, Culture, Personality

**Sapir (Boas's student) connected language, thought, and culture:**

**Key Ideas:**

**1. Language Shapes Thought:**
The language we speak influences how we think and perceive (later called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis).

**2. Culture as Individual Experience:**
Unlike Radcliffe-Brown's abstract structures, Sapir insisted culture exists in real people's experiences and psychological states.

**3. Personality in Culture:**
Cultural patterns are expressed through individual personalities—can't separate individual from culture.

**Influence:**
- Linguistic anthropology foundations
- Psychological focus in anthropology
- Attention to individual variation

### Abram Kardiner (1891-1981): Basic and Modal Personality

**Kardiner (psychoanalyst working with anthropologists) developed:**

**Basic Personality Structure:**
- Shared personality traits resulting from common childhood experiences in a culture
- Primary institutions (family, childrearing) shape basic personality
- Secondary institutions (religion, art) express that personality

**Modal Personality:**
- Most common personality type in a society
- Statistical concept (not everyone fits, but most cluster around modal type)

> **Example: Alorese (Indonesia)**
>
> **Primary Institutions:**
> - Mothers work in fields all day
> - Infants left with older siblings
> - Inconsistent care, frustration
>
> **Basic Personality:**
> - Mistrust, anxiety, suspicion
> - Difficulty with intimate relationships
> - Expressed in religion (fearful, punishing deities)
>
> **Secondary Institutions:**
> - Mythology reflects themes of abandonment
> - Rituals address anxiety

**Critique:** Heavily Freudian, deterministic, often stereotyped cultures.

## Core Concepts and Methods

### 1. Cultural Relativism Applied to Psychology

**The Principle:**
"Normal" psychology varies culturally. What's healthy in one culture may be pathological in another.

> **Example: Hearing Voices**
>
> **Western Psychology:** Auditory hallucinations indicate psychosis (schizophrenia).
>
> **Some Indigenous Cultures:** Hearing spirits/ancestors is normal, valued, part of shamanic calling.
>
> **Implication:** Mental health is culturally defined, not universal.

### 2. National Character Studies

**During WWII, anthropologists studied "national character":**

> **Ruth Benedict - *The Chrysanthemum and the Sword* (1946):**
>
> Studied Japanese culture from distance (during war, couldn't visit Japan):
> - Interviewed Japanese-Americans
> - Analyzed films, literature
> - Identified patterns (shame vs. guilt, hierarchy, obligation)
>
> **Used to:**
> - Predict Japanese behavior
> - Plan occupation of Japan
> - Understand "the enemy"
>
> **Problems:**
> - Essentialized and stereotyped
> - Served wartime propaganda
> - Treated cultures as homogeneous
> - Reduced complex nation to single "character"

National character studies are now rejected as overgeneralized and politically problematic. But they show how Culture and Personality was applied.

### 3. Cross-Cultural Child Development

**How do different childrearing practices shape personality?**

**Research:**
- Swaddling vs. not swaddling
- Nursing duration and weaning
- Toilet training strictness
- Parental warmth vs. distance
- Punishment styles

**Question:** Do these practices produce characteristically different personalities?

**Example:** Geoffrey Gorer argued Russian swaddling produced authoritarian personalities (now considered absurd oversimplification).

### 4. Projective Tests Cross-Culturally

**Methods:**
- Rorschach inkblot tests
- Thematic Apperception Tests (TAT)
- Drawing tests
- Administered to people in different cultures

**Goal:** Measure personality traits objectively across cultures.

**Problems:**
- Tests developed in Western contexts
- Cultural bias in interpretation
- Questionable validity
- Often confirmed researchers' stereotypes

---

## Critiques and Problems

### 1. Oversimplification and Stereotyping

**Critique:** Treating entire cultures as having single personality type erases individual variation.

**Reality:**
- People within any culture vary enormously
- Cultures aren't homogeneous
- "Modal personality" is statistical average, but real people aren't averages

### 2. Circular Reasoning

**The Problem:**
1. Observe cultural practices
2. Infer they produce certain personality
3. Claim personality explains cultural practices

**Example:**
- Pueblo are cooperative (observation)
- Therefore Pueblo have peaceful personality (inference)
- Therefore Pueblo culture is peaceful (explanation)

But you started by observing cooperation! This is circular.

### 3. Freudian Bias

**Heavy reliance on Freudian psychoanalysis:**
- Assumed universal psychological processes (Oedipus complex, etc.)
- Emphasized childhood sexuality and toilet training
- Often imposed Western psychological categories on other cultures

**Problem:** If psychology is culturally specific, why assume Freudian psychology is universal?

### 4. Politically Problematic

**National character studies served nationalism and war:**
- Stereotyped enemies
- Supported propaganda
- Reinforced cultural prejudices
- Sometimes used to justify policy

### 5. Methodological Issues

**Problems:**
- Small samples (Mead studied few dozen teenagers)
- Limited fieldwork time
- Language barriers
- Selective perception
- Difficulty verifying findings

## What Culture and Personality Got Right

### 1. Culture Shapes Psychology

**The core insight remains valid:**
- How you're raised affects how you think and feel
- Different cultures produce somewhat different psychological patterns
- "Normal" varies culturally

**Modern Psychology Confirms This:**
- Cross-cultural psychology shows cultural variation in cognition, emotion, motivation
- Developmental psychology shows childrearing matters
- Cultural neuroscience shows culture affects brain development

### 2. Biology Isn't Destiny

**Against biological determinism:**
- Gender roles vary culturally
- Adolescence is culturally shaped
- Mental health is culturally defined
- "Human nature" is flexible

**This was crucial for:**
- Feminism (if gender is cultural, it can change)
- Anti-racism (differences are cultural, not biological)
- Progressive social movements

### 3. Early Experience Matters

**Though often overstated, the basic idea holds:**
- Childhood experiences shape personality
- Cultural practices of childrearing have consequences
- Socialization is powerful

### 4. Individual and Culture Connect

**Against Radcliffe-Brown's abstract structures:**
- Culture exists in real people's experiences
- Can't separate individual from culture
- Psychological dimension of culture matters

## Legacy and Transformation

### What Happened to Culture and Personality?

**1950s-1960s: Decline**

**Reasons:**
- Critiques mounted
- Methods questioned
- Political problems apparent
- Overgeneralization obvious
- New approaches emerged

**But Ideas Didn't Disappear—They Transformed:**

### Psychological Anthropology (contemporary)

**Continues interest in culture-psychology connections but with:**
- More sophisticated methods
- Recognition of variation
- Less determinism
- More focus on how people actively create meaning
- Attention to emotion, cognition, self

### Medical Anthropology

**Culture-bound syndromes:**
- Some mental illnesses appear only in specific cultures
- Symptoms shaped by cultural expectations
- Illness narratives culturally constructed

### Cognitive Anthropology

**How does culture affect thinking?**
- Categorization
- Memory
- Reasoning
- Perception

**More empirical, less psychoanalytic than Culture and Personality.**

---

## Contemporary Relevance

### Where These Ideas Matter Today:

**Cross-Cultural Psychology:**
- Individualism vs. collectivism
- Independent vs. interdependent self
- Cultural differences in emotion, cognition, motivation

**Cultural Psychiatry:**
- How culture shapes mental illness
- Culturally appropriate treatment
- Avoiding Western psychiatric imperialism

**Childhood Development:**
- Attachment theory across cultures
- Parenting practices and outcomes
- Cultural models of child development

**Education:**
- Learning styles vary culturally
- Culturally responsive teaching
- Different concepts of intelligence

**Globalization:**
- How do people maintain cultural identity while adopting global practices?
- Cultural mixing and hybrid identities

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are there American personality patterns? What would they be? Is it even valid to generalize about a diverse nation?

**Question 2:** How much of your personality is cultural vs. individual? Can you even separate them?

**Question 3:** If culture shapes psychology so deeply, can people from different cultures truly understand each other?

**Question 4:** Was Mead wrong about Samoa, or just too optimistic? Does it matter for her central argument?

**Question 5:** Should anthropologists make generalizations about cultural psychology, or does that always risk stereotyping?

**Remember:** Culture and Personality was flawed—oversimplifying, stereotyping, politically problematic. But its core insight remains: culture profoundly shapes how we think, feel, and experience the world. Contemporary anthropology keeps this insight while rejecting crude determinism and overgeneralization. We're all cultural beings—our psychology reflects the cultures that shaped us. But we're also individuals who actively interpret, resist, and transform our cultures.
