# Marxist Anthropology and Political Economy: Power, Capitalism, Inequality (1960s-1990s)

---

## The Materialist Challenge

While interpretive anthropologists read culture as text, another group of anthropologists asked: **Who controls the means of production? Who benefits from existing arrangements? How does capitalism shape cultures worldwide?**

**Marxist anthropology** (also called **political economy approach**) insisted: You can't understand culture without understanding:
- Material conditions (economy, production)
- Power relations (class, exploitation)
- Historical processes (capitalism, colonialism)
- Global systems (world economy)

**The Critique of Previous Approaches:**

**Functionalism:** Assumes harmony, ignores conflict and inequality

**Structuralism:** Abstracts from history and power

**Interpretive Anthropology:** Aestheticizes culture, ignores material base

**Needed:** Attention to **political economy**—the relationship between power, economy, and culture.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Marx's Key Ideas for Anthropology

**Not orthodox Marxism but Marxist-inspired analysis:**

**1. Material Base / Ideological Superstructure:**

**Base (economic foundation):**
- Means of production (land, tools, factories)
- Relations of production (who owns what, who controls labor)
- Mode of production (feudalism, capitalism, etc.)

**Superstructure (culture, ideology):**
- Religion, art, law, politics
- Reflects and legitimizes economic base
- Can also transform base

**For Anthropology:** Culture isn't autonomous—it's connected to economic relations and power.

**2. Class Conflict:**

Societies divided by relationship to means of production:
- Owners vs. workers
- Exploiters vs. exploited
- Dominant class vs. subordinate classes

**Conflict, not harmony,** drives history.

**3. Historical Materialism:**

History progresses through changes in modes of production:
- Primitive communism → Slave society → Feudalism → Capitalism → (Socialism?)

**But anthropologists rejected** simple evolutionary scheme while keeping attention to historical change and material conditions.

**4. Ideology and False Consciousness:**

Dominant class's ideas become society's ideas:
- Religion justifies inequality ("God ordained hierarchy")
- Law protects property
- Culture naturalizes exploitation

**People may not recognize their exploitation** (false consciousness).

**5. Alienation:**

Under capitalism, workers are alienated from:
- Products of their labor
- Labor process itself
- Their human nature
- Each other

## Key Figures and Approaches

### Eric Wolf (1923-1999): Europe and the People Without History

**Background:**
- Austrian-born, fled Nazis, became American anthropologist
- Fieldwork in Mexico, Alps, Puerto Rico

**Major Work:** *Europe and the People Without History* (1982)

**The Argument:**

**Against "Peoples Without History":**

Traditional anthropology treated non-Western peoples as:
- Timeless, unchanging
- Isolated from world events
- "Primitive" stages
- Without history

**Wolf showed:** EVERYONE has history, and that history is **interconnected** through:
- Colonialism
- Capitalism
- Trade
- Migration
- Conquest

**World-System Analysis:**

Building on Immanuel Wallerstein, Wolf traced:
- How European capitalism transformed world
- How colonized peoples were active participants (not passive victims)
- How local cultures shaped and were shaped by global capitalism
- How "traditional" cultures are products of capitalist encounter

> **Example: "Primitive" Hunter-Gatherers**
>
> Anthropologists studied !Kung San as isolated foragers.
>
> **Wolf showed:** 
> - !Kung had long history of trade with neighbors
> - Affected by colonial boundaries
> - Pushed into marginal lands by pastoralists and farmers
> - Their "traditional" lifestyle was adaptation to marginalization
>
> **Not timeless primitives** but people with long history of interaction and adaptation.

**The Point:**

Can't study cultures in isolation. Must understand:
- Global capitalism
- Colonial history
- Trade networks
- Power relations
- Historical change

### Sidney Mintz (1922-2015): Sweetness and Power

**Major Work:** *Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History* (1985)

**The Story:**

How did sugar—a luxury for European elites in 1500—become cheap commodity for masses by 1900?

**The Answer: Capitalism, Slavery, and Empire**

**The System:**

1. **Caribbean plantations** (Jamaica, Barbados, Haiti)
   - Enslaved Africans forced to produce sugar
   - Brutal conditions, mass death
   - Profit to plantation owners and merchants

2. **European consumption**
   - Sugar in tea, coffee, chocolate
   - Working-class energy source
   - Calories for factory workers
   - New taste and habits

3. **Global trade**
   - Triangular trade: Europe → Africa (manufactured goods) → Americas (enslaved people) → Europe (sugar, cotton)
   - Capitalism driving slavery
   - Empire enabling extraction

**The Analysis:**

**Linked three levels:**
- **Macro:** World capitalist system, colonialism, slavery
- **Meso:** Plantations, merchants, factories
- **Micro:** Individual workers sweetening tea

> **A Cup of Tea:**
>
> British working-class woman, 1850, drinking sweetened tea:
>
> - **Immediate:** Tastes good, provides energy
> - **Structural:** Sugar from Caribbean slavery, tea from Indian/Ceylon colonialism, industrialization requiring cheap calories
> - **Historical:** Capitalism transforming global production and consumption
>
> That cup of tea connects to slavery, colonialism, capitalism, global trade, cultural change.

**The Point:**

Everyday consumption is **politically and economically produced**. Can't understand culture without understanding political economy.

### Maurice Godelier: Rationality and Ecology

**French Marxist anthropologist:**

**Key Contributions:**

**1. Rationality of "Primitive" Economics:**

Against assumption that non-capitalist economies are irrational:
- Showed logic of gift exchange
- Analyzed pre-capitalist rationalities
- Different economic logics, not inferior

**2. Ecology and Society:**

Material conditions (environment, technology, resources) shape:
- Social organization
- Ideology
- Power relations

But **not deterministic**—culture mediates environmental constraints.

### Political Ecology: Environment, Power, Culture

**Emerged from Marxist anthropology:**

**Key Questions:**
- Who controls resources?
- How does power shape environmental use?
- How does capitalism drive environmental degradation?

**Against Apolitical Ecology:**

Can't explain environmental problems without analyzing:
- Inequality in resource access
- Colonial/neocolonial extraction
- Capitalist accumulation
- Power relations

> **Example: Deforestation**
>
> **Apolitical explanation:** Population pressure, poverty, lack of education
>
> **Political ecology:** 
> - Land concentrated in elite hands
> - Poor pushed to marginal lands
> - Export agriculture for global market
> - Debt forcing resource extraction
> - Power relations driving deforestation

**Contemporary:** Political ecology is thriving subfield.

## Core Analytical Concepts

### 1. Mode of Production

**How society organizes production:**
- Who owns means of production?
- How is labor organized?
- How are goods distributed?

**Types:**
- Kin-based (reciprocity, lineage control)
- Tributary (peasants pay tribute to overlords)
- Capitalist (wage labor, profit-seeking)

**Coexistence:** Multiple modes can coexist (capitalism penetrating non-capitalist societies).

### 2. Class and Inequality

**Not just wealth difference but relationship to production:**
- Owners vs. non-owners
- Controllers vs. controlled
- Exploiters vs. exploited

**Cross-Culturally:**
- Chief vs. commoner
- Landlord vs. peasant
- Factory owner vs. worker
- Colonizer vs. colonized

### 3. Hegemony (Gramsci)

**Not just domination by force but by consent:**

Dominant class maintains power through:
- Controlling ideas
- Naturalizing hierarchy
- Getting subordinate classes to accept system

**Ideology works** to make exploitation seem natural or inevitable.

### 4. Articulation of Modes of Production

**How capitalism interacts with non-capitalist economies:**

- Capitalism doesn't replace pre-existing systems entirely
- They articulate (connect, interact)
- Capitalism exploits non-capitalist forms (peasant labor, household production)

> **Example: Migrant Labor**
>
> South African mines:
> - Men migrate for wage labor
> - Families remain in rural areas
> - Rural subsistence production subsidizes low wages (workers fed by rural household)
> - Capitalism articulates with peasant mode of production

### 5. World-Systems Theory (Wallerstein)

**Global capitalism as integrated system:**

**Three zones:**
- **Core:** Advanced industrial nations, high wages, democracy
- **Periphery:** Colonized/neo-colonized, resource extraction, low wages
- **Semi-periphery:** In between, mix of characteristics

**Unequal exchange:** Periphery exploited by core. Can't understand any part without understanding global system.

## Ethnographic Applications

### Peasant Studies

**Peasants as distinct class:**
- Agricultural producers
- Pay rent/taxes to overlords
- Household-based production
- Tied to land
- Subordinate but not proletarian

**Eric Wolf - Peasant Wars:**
- Analyzed peasant rebellions (Mexico, Russia, China, Vietnam, Algeria, Cuba)
- Showed peasants as revolutionary agents, not passive traditionalists
- Middle peasants (not poorest or richest) often lead rebellions

### Labor Studies

**Anthropology of work and workers:**
- Factory workers
- Migrant laborers
- Informal sector
- Gig economy
- Gendered division of labor

**Showing:** Work is culturally organized and politically contested.

### Development Critique

**Marxist anthropologists critiqued development projects:**

**"Development" Often Means:**
- Capitalism penetrating non-capitalist areas
- Dispossession (taking land, resources)
- Creating wage labor force
- Benefiting elites and foreign capital
- Destroying local economies

**Not neutral "modernization"** but capitalist expansion.

### Colonialism and Neocolonialism

**Analyzing colonial political economy:**
- Resource extraction
- Forced labor
- Cash cropping
- Destroying local industries
- Creating dependency

**Post-independence:**
- Formal colonialism ended but economic control continues
- Debt, unequal trade, foreign investment
- Neocolonialism

## Debates Within Marxist Anthropology

### Structure vs. Agency

**Question:** Do economic structures determine culture, or do people actively resist and transform?

**Structuralist Marxism (Althusser):** 
- Structures determine
- Limited human agency
- Ideology reproduces system

**Culturalist Marxism (E.P. Thompson, Raymond Williams):**
- People actively make culture
- Working-class agency
- Resistance and transformation

**Most anthropologists:** Both structure AND agency matter.

### Economic Determinism?

**Critique:** Does economic base really determine cultural superstructure?

**Response:** 
- Base shapes but doesn't determine
- Culture has relative autonomy
- Mutual influence, not one-way causation
- But economic relations are foundational

### Eurocentrism?

**Critique:** Marxism developed to understand European capitalism. Does it apply elsewhere?

**Debate:**
- Some say universal (capitalism is global)
- Others say need modification for non-Western contexts
- "Asiatic mode of production" controversy
- Must avoid imposing European categories

---

## Critiques of Marxist Anthropology

### 1. Economic Reductionism

**Critique:** Reduces everything to economics and power. What about:
- Meaning and symbols?
- Emotions and experience?
- Aesthetics and pleasure?
- Religion and ritual?

**Response:** Good Marxist anthropology attends to culture while connecting it to material conditions.

### 2. Overstates Capitalism's Power

**Critique:** 
- Treats capitalism as all-powerful
- Ignores local agency and resistance
- Underestimates cultural creativity

**Response:** People aren't just victims—they resist, adapt, appropriate.

### 3. Class Over Other Identities

**Critique:** 
- Prioritizes class over gender, race, ethnicity
- Can miss non-class forms of oppression
- Male-centered analysis

**Response:** Intersectional approach combines class with gender, race, etc.

### 4. Teleological History

**Critique:** 
- Assumes history progresses toward communism
- Stages of development (primitivism redux?)
- Eurocentric trajectory

**Response:** Contemporary political economy drops teleology, keeps historical materialism.

## Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

### What Remains:

**1. Political Economy Essential:**
Contemporary anthropology recognizes economy and power are crucial.

**2. Global Capitalism Matters:**
Can't study cultures in isolation from global economic system.

**3. Historical Context:**
Must understand colonialism, capitalism, historical change.

**4. Inequality and Power:**
Class, exploitation, domination are real and must be analyzed.

**5. Critique of Development:**
Anthropological skepticism of development projects continues.

### Transformations:

**Combined With:**
- Feminist analysis (gender AND class)
- Postcolonial theory (beyond Eurocentrism)
- Practice theory (agency AND structure)
- Interpretive insights (meaning AND material conditions)

**Contemporary Forms:**
- Neoliberalism studies
- Financialization
- Global supply chains
- Inequality research
- Climate justice (political ecology)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Does economic base really shape cultural superstructure, or is this reductionist?

**Question 2:** Can anthropology be politically engaged (Marxist) without losing objectivity/credibility?

**Question 3:** Is capitalism truly a global system, or do local cultures maintain autonomy?

**Question 4:** Should anthropology prioritize class analysis or intersectional analysis combining class, gender, race, etc.?

**Question 5:** What everyday objects/practices in your life connect to global capitalism like Mintz's sugar?

**Remember:** Marxist anthropology insisted anthropology must analyze power, inequality, capitalism, and history—not just interpret meaning or identify functions. This transformed the discipline permanently. Contemporary anthropology may not be "Marxist" but routinely analyzes political economy, inequality, global capitalism, and power relations. The core insights—material conditions matter, power shapes culture, capitalism is global, history is essential—remain foundational. But best combined with attention to meaning, agency, gender, and local creativity that pure economic determinism missed.
