# Contemporary Economic Anthropology: Globalization, Precarity, and Alternatives

---

## From Trobriands to Uber: Economic Anthropology Now

Classic economic anthropology studied kula rings, potlatches, and peasant economies. **Contemporary economic anthropology** studies:
- Neoliberal capitalism's global spread
- Informal economies in the Global South
- Platform capitalism (Uber, Amazon, Airbnb)
- Financial crises and inequality
- Resistance and alternatives

**Same questions, new contexts:** How do people make a living? Who controls? Who benefits? What alternatives exist?

## Neoliberalism: The Great Transformation Reversed?

### What Is Neoliberalism?

**Economic Doctrine (1970s-present):**
- Free markets solve problems
- Privatization of public goods
- Deregulation
- Individual responsibility
- Competition is good
- State should minimize intervention

**Key Figures:** Hayek, Friedman, Thatcher ("there is no society"), Reagan

**Implementation:**
- Structural adjustment (IMF, World Bank)
- Welfare state dismantling
- Union busting
- Trade liberalization
- Financialization

**Ideology:**
- Homo economicus (rational self-interested individual)
- Market freedom = human freedom
- Inequality = meritocracy
- "Trickle down" economics

### David Harvey: "A Brief History of Neoliberalism" (2005)

**Neoliberalism as Class Project:**

**Not Natural Evolution:**
- Deliberate policy
- Restore ruling class power (eroded by welfare state, unions)
- "Accumulation by dispossession"

**Dispossession:**
- Privatizing public assets
- Enclosing commons
- Financialization (debt)
- Land grabs
- Primitive accumulation ongoing

**Results:**
- Massive inequality growth
- Precarity
- Weakened labor
- Concentrated wealth

**"Creative Destruction":**
- Destroys social protections
- Creates markets in everything
- Transforms subjectivities

### Aihwa Ong: "Neoliberalism as Exception" (2006)

**Variegated Neoliberalism:**

**Not Uniform:**
- Different forms in different places
- Authoritarian neoliberalism (China, Singapore)
- Selective implementation
- Exceptions and variations

**"Neoliberalism as exception":**
- Applied to special economic zones
- Not entire countries uniformly
- Strategic deployment

**"Exceptions to neoliberalism":**
- Some populations excluded
- Refugees, migrants—bare life
- Differential rights

**Shows:** Neoliberalism isn't monolithic—anthropology reveals local variations.

### Tania Murray Li: "The Will to Improve" (2007)

**Development as Neoliberal Governmentality:**

**Indonesia:**
- Development projects
- Market solutions
- Privatize land
- "Improve" peasants

**Effects:**
- Dispossession
- Poverty
- Resistance

**Genealogy:**
- Traces development discourse
- Shows power/knowledge
- Expert rule

**Critique:** Development as governing populations, not helping them.

### Ethnographies of Neoliberalism

> **Example: Greece (Economic Crisis)**
>
> **Heath Cabot, Eirini Avramopoulou:**
> - Austerity imposed by EU/IMF
> - Privatization, pension cuts, unemployment
> - Young people leave (brain drain)
> - Solidarity economies emerge
> - Social movements
> - "Indignados"
>
> **Anthropology shows:** Human costs of austerity, resistance strategies.

> **Example: Russia (Post-Soviet Transition)**
>
> **Caroline Humphrey, Katherine Verdery:**
> - "Shock therapy" (rapid neoliberalization)
> - Privatization of state enterprises
> - Oligarchs emerge
> - Mafia capitalism
> - Poverty, mortality increased
>
> **Shows:** Neoliberal transition can be catastrophic.

### Neoliberal Subjectivities

**Governmentality (Foucault):**
- Neoliberalism creates "enterprise self"
- You are CEO of yourself
- Self-invest, self-improve
- Responsibilize individuals

**Examples:**
- "Human capital" (invest in education)
- "Gig economy" (entrepreneur of yourself)
- Self-help, productivity culture
- Therapy as self-management

**Critique:**
- Privatizes collective problems
- Blame individuals for structural issues
- Creates anxiety, burnout

## Informal Economies: Majority of the World

### Keith Hart's Discovery (1973)

**Ghana Fieldwork:**

**Formal Economy:**
- Waged employment
- Regulated
- Taxed
- Documented

**Informal Economy:**
- Self-employment
- Unregulated
- Untaxed
- "Off the books"

**Hart's Insight:**
- Most people in Global South work informally
- Not unemployed—working differently
- Creative survival strategies
- Parallel economy

**Coined Term:** "Informal sector"

### What Is Informal Economy?

**Characteristics:**
- Small-scale
- Low capital
- No written contracts
- Family/kin labor
- No state regulation
- Cash-based
- Flexible

**Examples:**
- Street vending
- Petty trade
- Artisan production
- Domestic work
- Unlicensed services
- Day labor

**Scale:**
- 60-80% of employment (sub-Saharan Africa)
- 50-60% (Latin America, South Asia)
- Majority of world's workers

### Debates on Informal Economy

**Positive View (Hernando de Soto):**

**"The Other Path" (1989):**
- Informal = entrepreneurial
- Regulations stifle business
- Formalize property (titling)
- Unleash capitalism

**Neoliberal Solution:**
- Remove barriers
- Create markets
- Informal becomes formal

**Critique:**
- Romanticizes precarity
- Ignores exploitation
- Blames regulation, not capitalism

**Critical View (Marxist, Feminist):**

**Informal as:**
- Survival, not choice
- Superexploitation
- Subsidizes formal economy (cheap goods/services)
- Articulated with capitalism

**Sharon Hutchinson, Luisa Margolies:**
- Women overrepresented
- Double burden (domestic + income)
- No protections
- Poverty wages

**Political Economy:**
- Informal economy supports capitalism
- Provides flexible, cheap labor
- No benefits, rights
- Accumulation by dispossession

### Ethnographies of Informal Work

> **Example: La Salada (Buenos Aires)**
>
> **Saskia Sassen:**
> - Massive informal market
> - Garment production, sales
> - Migrant labor
> - Global commodity chains
> - Counterfeit goods
> - Police bribes
>
> **Shows:** Informal deeply connected to global capitalism.

> **Example: Dharavi (Mumbai)**
>
> **Arjun Appadurai:**
> - Asia's largest informal settlement
> - Recycling, pottery, leather, textiles
> - Millions of dollars in production
> - Invisible in formal economy
> - Rich social networks
>
> **Complex:** Not just poverty—thriving economy.

> **Example: Street Vendors (New York, Delhi, etc.)**
>
> **Many studies:**
> - Police harassment
> - Confiscation of goods
> - Criminalization
> - Organizing resistance
> - Street Vendors Project (advocacy)
>
> **Shows:** Informal workers resist marginalization.

## Platform Capitalism: The Gig Economy

### What Is Platform Capitalism?

**Digital Platforms:**
- Uber, Lyft, Deliveroo, TaskRabbit
- Airbnb, Amazon Mechanical Turk
- Upwork, Fiverr

**Characteristics:**
- Algorithmic management
- No traditional employment
- "Independent contractors"
- On-demand labor
- Rating systems
- Precarity

**Nick Srnicek, "Platform Capitalism" (2017):**
- Platforms own infrastructure (apps)
- Extract data
- Monopolize (network effects)
- Control without owning (cars, homes)

### Uber Ethnographies

**Alex Rosenblat, "Uberland" (2018):**

**Drivers Discover:**
- Promised flexibility is illusion
- Algorithm controls (which rides, when, prices)
- Can't negotiate
- Deactivated without recourse
- No benefits, protections
- Wear on personal vehicles

**Information Asymmetry:**
- Uber knows everything (data)
- Drivers know little
- "Algorithmic management"
- Gamification (manipulates behavior)

**Not Sharing Economy:**
- Marketed as "sharing"
- Actually extractive capitalism
- Uber profits, drivers precarious

**Resistance:**
- Organizing (difficult—dispersed)
- Lawsuits (misclassification)
- Strikes
- Alternative platforms (cooperatives)

### The "Sharing Economy" Critique

**Airbnb, TaskRabbit, etc.:**

**Rhetoric:**
- Peer-to-peer sharing
- Community
- Extra income
- Democratization

**Reality:**
- Commodifies previously non-market (housing, labor)
- Evades regulations (taxes, safety)
- Increases housing costs (Airbnb)
- Precarious work
- Platform extracts rent

**Juliet Schor:**
- Studied sharing economy
- Found limited "sharing"
- Mostly commercial
- Reproduces inequality
- Race/class discrimination

**Critique:** Appropriates "sharing" language to legitimize extraction.

### Algorithmic Control

**How Algorithms Manage:**
- Assign tasks (opaque)
- Monitor performance
- Rating systems
- Surge pricing
- Deactivation (firing)

**Workers' Experience:**
- Invisible boss
- No negotiation
- Constant surveillance
- Anxiety (ratings)

**Anthropological Studies:**
- Interviews reveal frustration
- Workers "game" algorithms
- Develop informal knowledge
- Resist through tactics

### Debt as Extraction

**Maurizio Lazzarato, "The Making of the Indebted Man" (2012):**

**Debt = Power:**
- Controls behavior
- Future claims on labor
- Subjectification

**Student Debt, Credit Cards, Mortgages:**
- Financialize daily life
- Precarity
- Can't escape

**Anthropological Studies:**

> **Example: US Student Debt**
>
> **Caitlin Zaloom, "Indebted" (2019):**
> - Middle-class families in debt crisis
> - "Family finance" (parents + kids calculate)
> - Moral weight
> - Affects life choices
>
> **Shows:** Financialization reaches intimate family decisions.

> **Example: Microfinance**
>
> **Lamia Karim, "Microfinance and Its Discontents" (2011):**
> - Bangladesh microfinance
> - Promised poverty alleviation
> - Created debt dependency
> - Women borrowers shamed, harassed
> - Suicides
>
> **Critique:** Neoliberal development as exploitation.

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is neoliberalism ending, or has it become inescapable?

**Question 2:** Are informal economies oppressive (exploitation) or liberatory (autonomy)?

**Question 3:** Can platform capitalism be reformed (worker protections) or must it be replaced?

**Question 4:** Are cooperatives and commons viable alternatives, or marginal experiments?

**Question 5:** What might post-capitalist economy look like? Can anthropology help imagine it?

**Remember:** Contemporary economic anthropology reveals how neoliberal capitalism has transformed work, debt, precarity, and inequality globally. Informal economies are majority survival strategies, not exceptions. Platform capitalism repackages old exploitation with new technology. Financialization extracts through debt. But anthropology also documents resistance—cooperatives, commons, solidarity economies, degrowth, indigenous alternatives. From kula rings to Uber, economic anthropology shows economy is always social, cultural, political. Contemporary challenges are immense, but alternatives exist. Understanding how people actually make livings, resist exploitation, and imagine alternatives is anthropology's contribution to economic critique and transformation.
