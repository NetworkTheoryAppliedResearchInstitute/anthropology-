# Linguistic Relativity: Does Language Shape Thought?

---

## The Big Question

### Language and Cognition

**Central Debate:**
- Does the language we speak influence how we think?
- Do different languages create different worldviews?
- Are concepts universal or language-specific?

**Importance:**
- Philosophy (nature of thought)
- Psychology (cognition)
- Anthropology (cultural difference)

---

## The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

### Origins

**Edward Sapir (1884-1939):**
- American linguist/anthropologist
- Student of Franz Boas
- Studied Native American languages

**Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897-1941):**
- Student of Sapir
- Fire insurance investigator (day job)
- Studied Hopi, Mayan languages

**Key Idea:**
- Language structures thought
- Different languages = different cognitive patterns

---

## Two Versions

### Strong vs. Weak

**Strong Version (Linguistic Determinism):**
- Language **determines** thought
- Cannot think without language
- Different languages = incompatible worldviews
- **Few believe this today**

**Weak Version (Linguistic Relativity):**
- Language **influences** thought
- Habitual patterns
- Makes certain thoughts easier
- **More widely accepted**

---

## Classic Examples

### Whorf on Hopi

**Claim:**
- Hopi language: no tenses (like English)
- Time conceived differently
- Cyclical, not linear
- No clear past/present/future

**Impact:**
- Influential
- Challenged Western assumptions

**Critique:**
- Ekkehart Malotki (1983): *Hopi Time*
  - Hopi **does** have temporal markers
  - Whorf overstated
  - But: expressed differently than English

---

### Color Terms

**Basic Color Terms:**

**Berlin and Kay (1969):**
- *Basic Color Terms*
- Cross-linguistic study (~100 languages)

**Findings:**
- **Universal hierarchy** (evolutionary sequence)
  1. Black, white (all languages)
  2. Red
  3. Green, yellow
  4. Blue
  5. Brown
  6. Purple, pink, orange, gray

**If language has:**
- 3 terms: black, white, red
- 5 terms: black, white, red, green, yellow
- Pattern predictable

**Implication:**
- Universals (biology)
- **Against** strong relativity

**But:**

**Color Perception:**
- Language affects discrimination

**Dani (Papua New Guinea):**
- 2 basic color terms (light/dark)
- Can still perceive color differences
- But: slower at categorization tasks

**Russian:**
- Two words: *siniy* (dark blue), *goluboy* (light blue)
- No single "blue"
- Faster at discriminating shades (experiment)

**Berinmo (Papua New Guinea):**
- Different color boundaries
- Category *nol* includes greens and blues
- Affects perception at boundaries

**Conclusion:**
- Universals exist (biology)
- Language affects **attention** and **ease** of discrimination

---

## Space and Direction

### Absolute vs. Relative Frames

**English:**
- Egocentric (relative)
- "The cup is to the left of the plate"
- Depends on speaker's perspective

**Tzeltal (Mayan, Mexico):**
- Absolute (cardinal directions)
- "The cup is north of the plate"
- Independent of speaker

**Experiment (Levinson):**
- Tzeltal speakers remember spatial relations differently
- Rotate 180°: Tzeltal preserve absolute direction
- English speakers preserve relative direction

**Guugu Yimithirr (Australia):**
- Absolute only
- "Move your north foot"
- Constant mental compass

**Implication:**
- Language affects spatial cognition

---

## Grammar and Thought

### Grammatical Gender

**Languages:**
- Spanish, French, German, etc.
- Nouns assigned gender (masculine, feminine, neuter)
- Arbitrary (sun = masculine in Spanish, feminine in German)

**Experiment (Boroditsky):**
- Spanish/German speakers
- Describe objects
- Spanish speakers: bridge = masculine → "strong, sturdy"
- German speakers: bridge = feminine → "beautiful, elegant"

**Critique:**
- Task-specific (describing for experimenter)
- Not habitual thought
- Weak effect

---

### Evidentiality

**Grammatical Marking:**
- Source of information

**Turkish:**
- Past tense: witnessed vs. reported
- *gördüm* (I saw it myself)
- *görm**ü**ş* (I heard about it/inferred)

**Quechua:**
- Similar (direct vs. indirect)

**Implication:**
- Speakers more aware of evidence?
- Legal testimony (Aikhenvald study)

---

### Number

**Pirahã (Amazon):**
- Daniel Everett (linguist)
- No exact number words (just "few," "many")
- Difficulty with exact quantities (experiment)

**Critique:**
- Culture (no need for counting)
- Or: language?
- Chicken-egg problem

---

## Time

### Aymara (Andes)

**Spatial Metaphor:**
- Future = behind
- Past = in front
- **Opposite** of English
- Rationale: You can "see" the past (known)
- Can't "see" future (unknown)

**Gesture:**
- Point forward (past)
- Point back (future)

---

### Mandarin

**Vertical Time:**
- "Up" = earlier
- "Down" = later
- 上個月 (up month = last month)
- 下個月 (down month = next month)

**Experiment (Boroditsky):**
- Mandarin speakers: faster at vertical time judgments?
- Mixed results

---

## Agency and Causation

### English vs. Spanish/Japanese

**Accidents:**
- English: "I broke the vase" (agent explicit)
- Spanish: "Se me rompió el jarrón" (it broke itself on me, less agent)
- Japanese: Similar

**Experiment (Fausey & Boroditsky):**
- Spanish speakers: less memory for accidental agents
- English speakers: better memory

**Implication:**
- Language affects attention to agency

---

## Critiques of Linguistic Relativity

### Universalism

**Noam Chomsky:**
- Universal Grammar (UG)
- Innate language faculty
- Deep structure (universal)
- Thought independent of language

**Steven Pinker:**
- *The Language Instinct* (1994)
- Language is thought (mentalese)
- Translation possible (against strong relativity)
- "Mentalese" (language of thought)

---

### Methodological Issues

**Problems:**

**Conflating Language and Culture:**
- Hopi time: language or cultural practice?
- Hard to separate

**Experiment Design:**
- Linguistic tasks (not real-world thinking)
- Demand characteristics (participants guess hypothesis)

**Translation:**
- Describing across languages (biases)

**Causality:**
- Which way does it go?
  - Language → thought?
  - Thought → language?
  - Culture → both?

---

## Neo-Whorfianism

### Revival (1990s+)

**Researchers:**
- Lera Boroditsky, Stephen Levinson, John Lucy, Dedre Gentner

**Approach:**
- Experimental
- Cognitive psychology + linguistics
- Careful controls

**Findings:**
- **Weak effects** (confirmed)
- Language influences:
  - Attention
  - Ease of processing
  - Memory
- **Not** absolute determination

**Consensus:**
- Language matters (but not everything)
- Universals exist (biology, shared experience)
- Variation exists (language, culture)

---

## Sign Languages

### Do They Count?

**American Sign Language (ASL):**
- Full language (not English on hands)
- Grammar (distinct from English)
- Spatial grammar (3D)

**Question:**
- Does signing affect spatial cognition?

**Research:**
- Mixed results
- Some differences (spatial memory)
- But: small, task-specific

---

## Thought Without Language?

### Non-Linguistic Thought

**Animals:**
- Think (problem-solve, navigate)
- No language (complex syntax)

**Prelinguistic Infants:**
- Concepts (object permanence)
- Before language

**Aphasia (Language Loss):**
- Brain damage
- Language impaired
- Thought intact (often)

**Implication:**
- Thought ≠ language (completely)
- But: language enriches thought

---

## Metaphor and Thought

### Lakoff and Johnson

***Metaphors We Live By* (1980):**
- Conceptual metaphors structure thought
- "Argument is war" (English)
  - "Attack" positions, "defend" claims
- Language reflects (and reinforces) metaphors

**Cross-Linguistic:**
- Different metaphors (different languages)
- Time as space (universal, but varied)

---

## Practical Implications

### Translation

**Challenges:**
- Untranslatable words
- *Saudade* (Portuguese): melancholic longing
- *Hygge* (Danish): cozy togetherness
- *Schadenfreude* (German): joy at others' misfortune

**But:**
- Can explain (paraphrase)
- Not impossible, just longer

### Bilingualism

**Code-Switching:**
- Shift perspectives?
- Anecdotal (bilinguals report)

**Research:**
- Some evidence (thinking differently in L1 vs. L2)
- Moral reasoning (foreign language = more utilitarian)

### Legal/Political

**Courtroom:**
- Evidentiality (Turkish witness)
- Hearsay marked grammatically

**Orwell (1984):**
- "Newspeak" (control thought via language)
- Fiction, but influential

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can you think thoughts that your language cannot express?

**Question 2:** Do bilinguals think differently in each language?

**Question 3:** Could eliminating words eliminate concepts (Orwell's Newspeak)?

**Question 4:** Are some languages "better" for certain tasks (math, poetry)?

**Question 5:** What would a truly universal language look like?
