# Modes of Production: Organizing Economic Life

---

## Production as Social Organization

**How do societies:**
- Produce what they need?
- Organize labor?
- Distribute what's produced?
- Control resources?

**Mode of production:** The way a society organizes production—combining **forces of production** (technology, labor, resources) with **relations of production** (who controls, who benefits).

**Marxist framework:** Central to political economy anthropology.

**Shows:** Production isn't just technical—it's about **power, inequality, and social relations**.

---

## Marx's Concept: Modes of Production

### Components

**Forces of Production:**
- Technology (tools, machines)
- Labor power (human work)
- Raw materials
- Knowledge, skills

**Relations of Production:**
- Who owns means of production?
- Who controls labor?
- How is surplus extracted?
- Class relations

**Together:** Constitute mode of production.

### Historical Materialism

**Marx's Theory:**
- Economic base determines social superstructure
- History = succession of modes of production
- Contradictions within modes → change
- Class struggle drives history

**Modes in Sequence (Marx):**
1. Primitive communism
2. Ancient (slavery)
3. Feudalism
4. Capitalism
5. Socialism/Communism (future)

**Anthropological Critique:**
- Too unilinear (not all societies follow this path)
- Eurocentric
- Oversimplifies non-Western societies

**But Framework Useful:** Analyzing production organization, class, inequality.

## Kin-Ordered or "Primitive Communism"

### Characteristics

**Small-Scale Societies:**
- Hunter-gatherers
- Many horticultural societies
- Pastoralists (some)

**No Class Division:**
- Communal ownership of land/resources
- Everyone works
- No exploitation
- Egalitarian (relatively)

**Kinship Organizes Production:**
- Labor by age, gender, kinship
- Distribution through sharing
- Reciprocity, not markets

**Egalitarian:**
- Minimal wealth differences
- No chiefs or classes
- Social leveling mechanisms

### Examples

> **!Kung San (Kalahari Foragers):**
>
> - Collective foraging
> - Meat shared widely
> - No accumulation
> - "Insulting the meat" (prevents boasting)
> - Egalitarian ethos
> - Kinship-based cooperation

> **Trobriand Islanders (Pre-Colonial):**
>
> - Matrilineal land ownership (collective)
> - Chiefs but not exploitative
> - Redistribution through feasts
> - Reciprocity organizing exchange
> - Limited inequality

**Debate:** Were these truly egalitarian or is this romanticization?

**Eleanor Leacock:** Egalitarianism destroyed by colonialism—not inherent "primitiveness."

### Marshall Sahlins: Domestic Mode of Production

**"Stone Age Economics" (1972):**

**Household Production:**
- Production for use, not exchange
- Underproduction (don't maximize)
- Social limits on accumulation
- Anti-surplus bias

**Why Underproduce?**
- Needs easily met
- More work = more sharing obligations
- Can't accumulate (leveling mechanisms)
- "Original affluent society"

**Contradiction:**
- Households want to limit labor
- But social obligations demand surplus for exchange
- Tension drives system

**Challenged:** Assumption that people always maximize.

## Tributary Modes

### Feudalism (European)

**Relations of Production:**
- Lords own land
- Peasants (serfs) work land
- Surplus extracted as rent (labor, kind, money)
- Tied to land (not free to leave)

**Surplus Extraction:**
- Corvée labor (work lord's fields)
- Share of harvest
- Feudal dues, taxes

**Reproduction:**
- Serfs reproduce themselves and lords
- Extra-economic coercion (law, custom, force)
- Not market-driven

**Anthropological Interest:**
- Peasant studies
- Resistance ("weapons of the weak")
- Moral economy

> **European Feudalism:**
>
> - Three estates (clergy, nobility, commoners)
> - Manorial system
> - Customary rights (commons)
> - Serfdom until Modern period

### Asiatic Mode (Debated Concept)

**Marx's Idea:**
- State owns land
- Peasants pay taxes to state
- Centralized irrigation (hydraulic despotism)
- Village communes

**Examples Proposed:**
- Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia
- Inca Empire
- Imperial China
- Mughal India

**Karl Wittfogel (1957):**
- "Oriental Despotism"
- Large-scale irrigation requires state control
- Creates autocracy
- But: Criticized as racist, simplistic

**Anthropologists Skeptical:**
- Residual category for non-European systems
- Eurocentric
- Empirically questionable
- Overgeneralizes

**Mostly Abandoned:** But raises question of state-based tributary systems.

### Inca Empire: Andean Variant

> **Inca Mode of Production:**
>
> - State owns land (in principle)
> - Ayllu (kin groups) work communally
> - Mit'a labor tax (corvée)
> - State redistributes (qollqa storehouses)
> - No markets or money
> - Reciprocity ideology ("generosity")
>
> **But:** Exploitative—state extracts labor, gives back less.

**John Murra:** "Vertical Archipelago"—Andean ecological zones, control through kinship and reciprocity.

## Slavery

### Ancient Slavery

**Characteristics:**
- Slaves = property
- Total control over labor
- Violent coercion
- Production for owners

**Classical Examples:**
- Ancient Greece, Rome
- Large estates (latifundia)
- Mines, agriculture, domestic labor

**Slave Status:**
- War captives, debtors, criminals
- Hereditary (some systems)
- Could be freed (manumission)

**Anthropology:**
- Relatively rare as dominant mode
- More often, slavery within other modes

### Plantation Slavery (Atlantic System)

**16th-19th Centuries:**

**Different from Ancient:**
- Racialized
- Capitalist (producing for markets)
- Industrial scale
- Chattel slavery (hereditary, permanent)

**Relations of Production:**
- Planters own means of production (land, slaves)
- Slaves produce commodities (sugar, cotton, tobacco)
- Sold on world markets
- Profits to planters

**Hybrid Mode:**
- Slavery + capitalism
- Coerced labor + market exchange
- Primitive accumulation for European capitalism

> **Caribbean Sugar Plantations:**
>
> - African slaves forced labor
> - Industrial-scale agriculture
> - Export to Europe
> - Profits fuel capitalism
> - Millions enslaved, millions died
>
> **Sidney Mintz, "Sweetness and Power":**
> - Sugar links slavery, capitalism, colonialism
> - Working-class consumption in Europe
> - Built on slave labor

**Eric Williams, "Capitalism and Slavery":**
- Slavery funded industrial revolution
- Not separate from capitalism—integral

## Capitalism

### Defining Features

**Relations of Production:**
- Capitalists own means of production
- Workers sell labor power (wage labor)
- Free labor (legally, not tied to land/master)
- Surplus extracted as profit

**Market-Driven:**
- Commodities produced for exchange
- Price mechanism
- Competition
- Accumulation imperative

**Classes:**
- Bourgeoisie (capitalists)
- Proletariat (workers)
- Class conflict

**Alienation:**
- Workers separated from means of production
- Labor power becomes commodity
- Products alien to producers

### Primitive Accumulation

**How Capitalism Emerges?**

**Marx:** "So-called primitive accumulation"—violent separation of producers from means of production.

**Processes:**
- Enclosure (privatizing commons)
- Colonialism (seizing land, resources)
- Slavery (initial capital)
- Dispossession

**Not Natural Evolution:** Forced transformation.

> **English Enclosure:**
>
> - Common lands privatized (16th-18th centuries)
> - Peasants evicted
> - Became wage laborers
> - Capitalist agriculture
>
> **"Enclosure: A tragedy of the commons"**—but from below, not mismanagement.

**David Harvey:** "Accumulation by dispossession"—ongoing process, not just historical origin.

### Industrial Capitalism

**19th Century:**
- Factory system
- Machine production
- Urbanization
- Proletarianization

**Anthropology:**
- Worker culture
- Resistance (unions, strikes)
- Class consciousness

**E.P. Thompson, "The Making of the English Working Class":**
- Workers made themselves through struggle
- Culture and agency

### Late/Advanced Capitalism

**20th-21st Century:**
- Finance capitalism
- Globalization
- Neoliberalism
- Precarity, gig economy
- Digital capitalism

**Anthropology:**
- Informal economies
- Flexible accumulation (David Harvey)
- Globalization effects
- Inequality

## Articulation of Modes

### Coexistence and Interaction

**Real Societies:** Rarely pure modes—combinations.

**Articulation Theory (Althusser, Meillassoux, Wolpe):**
- Multiple modes within one society
- Articulate (connect) in specific ways
- Dominant mode structures others

**Example: Colonialism:**
- Capitalist mode (colonial economy)
- Articulates with kin-ordered mode (indigenous)
- Extracts surplus through both

> **Southern African Mines:**
>
> - Capitalist mining (wage labor)
> - Workers from rural areas (kin-ordered)
> - Wages too low to reproduce (need subsistence agriculture)
> - Rural areas subsidize capitalism
> - Migrant labor system
>
> **Claude Meillassoux:** Domestic mode reproduces labor for capitalism.

**Feminist Critique:**
- Women's unpaid domestic labor reproduces labor power
- Household = capitalist + patriarchal
- Articulation of modes

**World-Systems Theory (Wallerstein):**
- Core (capitalist)
- Periphery (multiple modes, articulated to serve core)
- Semi-periphery (intermediate)

## Modes of Production and Inequality

### Class and Exploitation

**Egalitarian Modes:**
- Kin-ordered
- Minimal surplus extraction

**Class-Based Modes:**
- Slavery, feudalism, capitalism
- Systematic exploitation
- Ruling class lives off surplus produced by others

**Mechanism Varies:**
- Slavery: direct coercion
- Feudalism: extra-economic (custom, law)
- Capitalism: economic (market compulsion)

**But All:** Transfer of surplus from producers to non-producers.

### Gender and Production

**Feminist Anthropology:**
- Modes of production are also gendered
- Women's labor invisible
- Domestic labor reproduces capitalism

**Meillassoux, Godelier:**
- Control of women's reproduction
- Marriage exchanges
- Women as producers and reproducers

**Eleanor Burke Leacock:**
- Egalitarian societies had gender equality
- Colonialism introduced patriarchy
- Modes of production shape gender relations

## Contemporary Transformations

### Neoliberal Capitalism

**Characteristics:**
- Privatization
- Deregulation
- Flexible labor
- Financialization
- Austerity

**Effects:**
- Increased inequality
- Precarity
- Informalization
- Global value chains

**David Harvey:** "Flexible accumulation"—post-Fordism.

### Informal Economies

**Global South:**
- Majority work informally
- Outside wage labor
- Multiple livelihoods
- Not "pre-capitalist" but articulated with capitalism

**Keith Hart:** Coined "informal economy" (Ghana, 1970s)

**Debate:**
- Survival strategy or resistance?
- Exploitation or autonomy?

### Digital Capitalism

**Platform Economy:**
- Uber, Amazon, Deliveroo
- "Gig work"
- Algorithmic control
- No traditional employment

**Mode of Production?**
- Still capitalism (wage labor, profit)
- But new forms of control, surveillance
- Blurs employee/contractor

### Alternatives?

**Commons:**
- Open source, Wikipedia
- Resist commodification
- Cooperative production

**Cooperatives:**
- Worker-owned
- Democratic control
- Mondragón (Spain)

**Degrowth, Buen Vivir:**
- Challenge growth imperative
- Alternative values
- Indigenous epistemologies

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are we still in capitalism, or has something fundamentally changed (digital, platform, etc.)?

**Question 2:** Were kin-ordered societies truly egalitarian, or does this romanticize the past?

**Question 3:** Can cooperatives and commons provide alternative to capitalism, or are they marginal?

**Question 4:** Is class still the primary form of inequality, or have other forms (race, gender) displaced it?

**Question 5:** What might post-capitalist mode of production look like?

**Remember:** Modes of production aren't just economic—they're about power, class, gender, exploitation. How production is organized shapes society fundamentally. Kin-ordered modes relatively egalitarian; tributary modes extract through extra-economic coercion; capitalism through "free" wage labor. But no mode exists pure—articulation of modes more common. Understanding modes reveals how inequality is systematically produced and reproduced. Capitalism isn't natural or eternal—it's historically specific, produced through violence (primitive accumulation), and potentially transformable. Alternatives exist but are constrained by global capitalism's dominance. The framework helps analyze who controls, who benefits, who is exploited—political questions at heart of economic anthropology.
