# Descent Systems: How Societies Trace Kinship

---

## Kinship: The Foundation of Social Organization

In many societies, **kinship is the primary organizing principle of social life**. It determines:
- Who you're related to
- What groups you belong to
- Who you can marry
- Who you inherit from
- Who you have obligations to
- Your social identity

**Descent systems** are the rules for tracing kinship connections across generations—determining which ancestors you're connected to and which descendants you're responsible for.

**Anthropology's insight:** These aren't "natural" or biological—they're **cultural constructions** that vary dramatically across societies.

## What Is Descent?

### Descent vs. Kinship

**Kinship:** All socially recognized relationships based on presumed biological connection or marriage.

**Descent:** The specific principle by which group membership is traced across generations.

**The Question:** Through which parent do you trace your lineage?

### Biological vs. Social

**Important:** Descent is **social**, not biological.

**Biological fact:** Everyone has two biological parents.

**Social reality:** Societies choose which connections "count" for group membership, inheritance, identity.

> **Example:**
> 
> You biologically descend from all four grandparents equally.
> 
> But many societies say:
> - Your father's father's line matters (patrilineal)
> - OR your mother's mother's line matters (matrilineal)
> - OR both matter equally (bilateral)
> 
> **Cultural choice, not biological necessity.**

## Types of Descent Systems

### 1. Patrilineal Descent (Agnatic)

**Rule:** Trace descent through males only.

**You belong to:** Your father's descent group.

**Membership passes:** Father → son → grandson

**Women:** Born into father's group, but their children belong to husband's group.

**Visualization:**
```
Grandfather (Group A)
    |
Father (Group A) ---- Mother (Group B)
    |
YOU (Group A)
    |
Your children (Group A if you're male)
Your children (Husband's group if you're female)
```

**Characteristics:**

**Group Formation:**
- Patrilineages (traced lineages through males)
- Patriclans (larger groups, can't trace exact connections)
- Corporate groups (own property, have political functions)

**Residence:**
- Usually patrilocal (wife moves to husband's family)

**Inheritance:**
- From father to sons
- Women often excluded from land/property

**Authority:**
- Male elders
- Father's authority over children

**Widespread:** 
~45% of world's societies (historically), especially:
- Pastoralists (Middle East, East Africa, Central Asia)
- Agricultural societies (much of Africa, Asia, Melanesia)
- Many indigenous American groups

> **Example: Nuer (Sudan)**
>
> Evans-Pritchard's classic study:
> - Segmentary lineage system
> - All Nuer trace descent through males to founding ancestors
> - Lineages form nested political units
> - Cattle inheritance father to son
> - Bride wealth payments between patrilineages
> - Political alliances based on patrilineal connections
>
> **Your identity = your patrilineage**

> **Example: Traditional China**
>
> - Patrilineal descent groups (zu)
> - Ancestor worship focused on male ancestors
> - Sons necessary to continue family line
> - Property inherited by sons
> - Women marry out, join husband's family
> - Genealogies trace male lines only

**Modern Echoes:**
- Many Western societies historically patrilineal (surnames)
- "Family name" = father's name
- Property to male heirs (primogeniture)
- Though now becoming more bilateral

### 2. Matrilineal Descent (Uterine)

**Rule:** Trace descent through females only.

**You belong to:** Your mother's descent group.

**Membership passes:** Mother → daughter → granddaughter

**But also:** Mother → son → son's children ALSO belong to mother's group

**Visualization:**
```
Grandmother (Group A)
    |
Mother (Group A) ---- Father (Group B)
    |
YOU (Group A, whether male or female)
    |
Your children (Group A if you're female)
Your children (Wife's group if you're male)
```

**Characteristics:**

**IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:**
Matrilineal ≠ matriarchal (rule by women)

**Authority Often Male:**
- Mother's brother has authority (not father)
- Avunculate: special relationship with maternal uncle
- Father may be affectionate but lacks formal authority

**Group Formation:**
- Matrilineages through females
- Matriclans

**Residence:**
- Matrilocal (husband moves to wife's village) OR
- Avunculocal (couple moves near wife's maternal uncle)

**Inheritance:**
- Mother's brother → sister's son
- Property stays in matrilineage

**Less Common:**
~15% of societies, including:
- Many horticultural societies (West/Central Africa, parts of Southeast Asia, Pacific)
- Some Native American groups (Hopi, Iroquois, Cherokee)

> **Example: Trobriand Islanders (Papua New Guinea)**
>
> Malinowski's fieldwork:
> - Matrilineal descent
> - Children belong to mother's clan
> - Inherit from mother's brother (not father)
> - Father is affectionate caregiver but not authority figure
> - Father gives gifts to children but they're not his heirs
> - Mother's brother is disciplinarian and future provider
>
> **Procreation theory:** Spirit enters woman; semen doesn't create child (cultural theory supporting matrilineal ideology)

> **Example: Minangkabau (Indonesia)**
>
> World's largest matrilineal society (~4 million):
> - Women inherit family land and houses
> - Women remain in ancestral home
> - Men move between birth home and wife's home
> - Property controlled by senior women
> - But religious/political authority often male
> - Matrilineal descent, but not full female authority

> **Example: Iroquois (North America)**
>
> - Matrilineal clans
> - Women own longhouses and cultivated land
> - Women choose male chiefs (though chiefs are male)
> - Women can remove chiefs
> - Significant female political influence
> - Iroquois Confederacy influential in US democracy

**The Paradox:**
Men often hold authority even in matrilineal societies. Why?
- Crosscutting systems (political, religious may be male-dominated)
- Colonial influence often strengthened male power
- Complex relationship between descent and authority

### 3. Bilateral Descent (Cognatic)

**Rule:** Trace descent through both parents equally.

**You belong to:** Both mother's and father's descent groups.

**Membership:** Flexible, overlapping networks.

**Visualization:**
```
All four grandparents equally important
    |
Both parents equally important
    |
YOU (connected to both sides)
    |
Your children (connected to all grandparents)
```

**Characteristics:**

**No Discrete Groups:**
- Not corporate descent groups
- Overlapping, ego-centered kindreds
- Everyone's kindred is different

**Kindred:**
- YOUR relatives on both sides
- But your siblings' kindreds ≠ your cousins' kindreds
- Can't form permanent groups (everyone's is unique)

**Flexibility:**
- Can emphasize father's or mother's side situationally
- Bilateral = options

**Residence:**
- Neolocal (new household) common
- Or flexible

**Inheritance:**
- From both parents
- Often equal to sons and daughters (modern trend)

**Common In:**
- Modern Western societies (U.S., Europe)
- Foraging societies (flexibility important)
- Some Southeast Asian societies

> **Example: United States (contemporary)**
>
> - Surnames usually patrilineal (father's last name)
> - But kinship bilateral (both sides matter)
> - Holidays with both families
> - Inheritance from both parents (legally equal)
> - Both grandparent sets equally "real" grandparents
> - Though some patrilineal echoes remain

> **Example: Inuit (Arctic)**
>
> - Bilateral kinship
> - Flexible group membership
> - Can affiliate with either parent's group
> - Useful in harsh environment (flexibility = survival)
> - Personal kindred networks
> - Naming practices create spiritual kinship

**Advantages:**
- Flexibility, larger potential support network
- Gender equality (potentially)

**Disadvantages:**
- Hard to form cohesive descent groups
- Difficult to organize politically through kinship alone
- Inheritance can be complicated

### 4. Double Descent (Dual Descent)

**Rule:** Trace some things through fathers, other things through mothers.

**You belong to:** BOTH a patrilineage AND a matrilineage simultaneously.

**Different Functions:**
- Patrilineage for X (e.g., land, political office)
- Matrilineage for Y (e.g., ritual objects, moveable property)

**Rare:** <5% of societies.

> **Example: Yako (Nigeria)**
>
> Classic case studied by Daryll Forde:
> 
> **Patrilineal for:**
> - Land ownership
> - Residence
> - Farming rights
> - Political authority
>
> **Matrilineal for:**
> - Moveable property (livestock, tools, money)
> - Currency inheritance
> - Certain ritual obligations
> - Some food taboos
>
> **Why?** 
> - Land immobile → passed through stable local group (patrilineage)
> - Moveable wealth → passed through matrilineage
> - Two complementary systems

> **Example: Some Pacific Societies**
>
> - Land through one line
> - Magical knowledge through other
> - Ritual responsibilities divided

**Complex:** Requires cognitive tracking of two systems simultaneously.

## Descent Groups and Their Functions

### What Are Descent Groups?

**Corporate Groups:**
- Persist beyond individual members' lifespans
- Own property collectively
- Have political/ritual functions
- Control member behavior
- Provide mutual aid

**Types:**

**Lineage:**
- Demonstrable genealogical connections
- Can trace links to apical ancestor
- 3-6 generations typically

**Clan:**
- Larger, can't trace exact connections
- Claim common ancestry (may be mythical)
- Often totemic (associated with animal/plant)

**Moiety:**
- Society divided into two halves
- Everyone belongs to one or the other
- Often exogamous (must marry outside)

### Functions of Descent Groups

**1. Property Ownership:**
- Land, cattle, resources
- Corporate ownership
- Managed by living members, passed to descendants

**2. Political Organization:**
- Lineages as political units
- Segmentary lineage systems (nested hierarchy)
- Alliance and conflict organized through kinship

**3. Religious/Ritual:**
- Ancestor worship within lineage
- Lineage shrines, ceremonies
- Ritual specialists from specific lineages

**4. Mutual Aid:**
- Economic cooperation
- Defense
- Marriage payments
- Support in disputes

**5. Social Identity:**
- Who you are = your descent group
- Behavior expectations
- Loyalty and solidarity

**6. Regulation:**
- Exogamy rules (marry outside)
- Control member behavior
- Resolve internal disputes

## Comparative Questions

### Why Different Systems?

**Theories (debated):**

**Economic Base:**
- Pastoralism → patrilineal (mobile herds, male labor)
- Horticulture → often matrilineal (women farmers)
- Foraging → bilateral (flexibility)

**But:** Many exceptions, not deterministic.

**Historical Process:**
- Specific historical developments
- Contact, colonialism, state formation
- No single evolutionary trajectory

**Ecological:**
- Environment affects subsistence
- Subsistence affects residence
- Residence affects descent

**But:** Not mechanistic causation.

**Current View:** Multiple factors, historical contingency, no simple explanation.

### Transitions

**Descent systems can change:**

**Common Shift:** Matrilineal → patrilineal (less common reverse)

**Why?**
- Colonial influence (European patriarchy imposed)
- State formation (male political control)
- Capitalism (individual property, male wage labor)
- Missionary influence (Christian patriarchal models)

> **Example: Cherokee**
>
> - Traditionally matrilineal
> - US government pressure to adopt patrilineal system
> - Land allotment to male heads of household
> - Some matrilineal practices persist but weakened

## Contemporary Relevance

### Modern Transformations

**Kinship Still Matters:**
- Even in "modern" societies
- Who you marry, where you live
- Inheritance, care for elderly
- Social networks and support

**But Changing:**
- Bilateral increasingly common globally
- Urbanization weakens corporate descent groups
- Individual rights vs. kin obligations
- State/market replacing kin functions

**New Questions:**
- Adoption (creates kinship without descent)
- Reproductive technologies (gamete donation, surrogacy)
- Same-sex couples (how do descent systems apply?)
- Blended families (stepchildren, half-siblings)
- Chosen families (fictive kinship)

**Descent systems provide:** Framework for thinking about how kinship is culturally constructed—even when systems themselves are changing.

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Why do you think patrilineal systems are more common than matrilineal? Is this biological, historical, or cultural?

**Question 2:** In bilateral systems like the US, can you identify any patrilineal "echoes" (last names, inheritance patterns)?

**Question 3:** Do you think descent systems will disappear in modern societies, or will they persist in new forms?

**Question 4:** How would same-sex marriage work in a strict patrilineal or matrilineal system?

**Question 5:** What are advantages and disadvantages of each descent system for individuals? For societies?

**Remember:** Descent systems show kinship is culturally constructed. Societies make different choices about how to trace connections across generations. These choices have profound consequences—shaping identity, organizing society, determining rights and obligations. No system is "natural"—they're all cultural solutions to universal human questions: Who am I related to? What groups do I belong to? Who has claims on me? Understanding descent systems reveals how culture shapes one of humanity's most "natural-seeming" domains.
