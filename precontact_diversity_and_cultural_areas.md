## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Was the Amazon a "virgin wilderness" or an anthropogenic landscape?

**Question 2:** How do we reconcile conflicting portrayals (e.g., Yanomami as "fierce" vs. "noble savage")?

**Question 3:** What can pre-contact diversity tell us about human adaptability?

**Question 4:** Are cultural area classifications useful or oversimplifying?

**Question 5:** How should anthropologists represent violence in ethnography?
