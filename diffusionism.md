# Diffusionism: Culture Spreads, Not Evolves (1880s-1930s)

---

## A Different Answer to Cultural Similarity

Why do cultures around the world share similar practices? Why do so many societies have flood myths, build pyramids, practice agriculture, or use similar tools?

**Evolutionists answered:** Independent evolution—all societies pass through the same stages, so they independently develop similar practices.

**Diffusionists answered:** Contact and borrowing—cultural traits spread from one society to another through trade, migration, and conquest. Similarities reflect historical connections, not parallel evolution.

This debate—**independent invention vs. diffusion**—shaped early anthropology and remains relevant today.

## Core Diffusionist Ideas

### The Basic Principle

**Cultural traits (ideas, technologies, practices) spread from their point of origin to other societies through:**
- Trade and exchange
- Migration and colonization
- Conquest and empire
- Missionary activity
- Imitation and borrowing

**Key Insight:** Humans are creative but also lazy—it's easier to borrow a good idea than invent it yourself. Most cultural traits diffuse rather than being independently invented.

### Diffusion vs. Independent Invention

> **Example: The Wheel**
>
> **Evolutionist explanation:** The wheel is so useful that any advancing society would invent it independently. Different societies invented it at different times depending on their evolutionary stage.
>
> **Diffusionist explanation:** The wheel was invented once (probably in Mesopotamia ~3500 BCE) and spread through trade and conquest. Societies without wheels didn't have contact with wheel-using societies.
>
> **Evidence:** The wheel's distribution suggests diffusion—it spread across Eurasia but never reached the Americas (until Europeans arrived) or sub-Saharan Africa. If it were independently invented, we'd expect more random distribution.

### Diffusion Processes

**1. Stimulus Diffusion:**
The idea spreads, but the specific form changes.
> **Example:** Sequoyah, a Cherokee, invented a syllabary for writing Cherokee after seeing English writing. He borrowed the idea of writing, but created a completely different system.

**2. Direct Diffusion:**
The exact practice or item spreads.
> **Example:** Mobile phones spread worldwide in nearly identical forms.

**3. Forced Diffusion:**
Conquest or colonialism imposes cultural practices.
> **Example:** Spanish forced Christianity on colonized Americas.

**4. Indirect Diffusion:**
Traits pass through intermediary societies.
> **Example:** Chinese inventions (paper, gunpowder, compass) reaching Europe through Islamic societies.

## Schools of Diffusionism

### 1. British Diffusionism (Extreme): The Egypt Hypothesis

**Main Proponents:** Grafton Elliot Smith, W.J. Perry

**The Radical Claim:**
ALL civilization originated in ancient Egypt and spread worldwide. Every pyramid, every sun god, every complex society—all traced back to Egypt.

**Grafton Elliot Smith's Argument:**

Smith, an anatomist who studied Egyptian mummies, became convinced that:
- Ancient Egyptians were uniquely creative geniuses
- They invented civilization (agriculture, cities, writing, religion, etc.)
- Egyptian colonizers and traders spread civilization globally
- "Primitive" peoples couldn't create civilization themselves

> **The "Evidence":**
>
> Smith pointed to similarities worldwide:
> - **Pyramids:** Egypt, Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica
> - **Sun worship:** Common across cultures
> - **Mummification:** Egypt, Andes, elsewhere
> - **Hieroglyphic writing:** Egypt, Maya
> - **Megalithic monuments:** Egypt, Europe, Pacific
>
> He concluded all these **must** have diffused from Egypt.

**The Problem:**

This was wild speculation, not science:
- Chronology was wrong (many "copies" predated Egyptian originals)
- No evidence of Egyptian contact with Americas or Pacific
- Similarities were superficial (pyramids served different functions, had different construction)
- Racist assumption that only Egyptians could invent things
- Ignored independent invention as explanation

**Why It Matters:**

British extreme diffusionism was quickly rejected, but it reveals:
- Diffusionism could be as racist as evolutionism (assuming only one "superior" culture invents)
- The danger of seeing superficial similarities as proof of connection
- The importance of chronology and actual evidence of contact

### 2. German/Austrian Diffusionism (Kulturkreise): Culture Circles

**Main Proponents:** Friedrich Ratzel, Leo Frobenius, Fritz Graebner, Wilhelm Schmidt

**The Theory:**

Cultural traits cluster into **culture circles** (Kulturkreise) that spread from centers of invention:

**Method:**
1. Identify culture complexes (clusters of associated traits)
2. Map their geographic distribution
3. Reconstruct historical spread patterns
4. Identify original centers

> **Example: The Bow and Arrow Complex**
>
> German diffusionists traced the bow and arrow's spread:
> - Invention somewhere in Old World
> - Associated traits: quivers, arrow types, hunting practices, myths about the bow
> - Spread patterns visible in geographic distribution
> - Later arrivals overlay earlier patterns

**Contributions:**

- More systematic than British diffusionism
- Emphasized detailed ethnographic documentation
- Created vast comparative databases
- Recognized multiple centers of invention (not just Egypt)

**Problems:**

- Still assumed all similarity meant diffusion (underestimated independent invention)
- Reconstructions were speculative
- Limited use of archaeology for chronology
- Culture circle boundaries were often arbitrary

**Austrian Catholic Mission:**

Wilhelm Schmidt (a Catholic priest) used Kulturkreise theory to argue:
- The oldest culture circle had monotheism
- Current polytheism was degradation from original monotheism
- This "proved" Christian creation narrative

This showed how diffusionism, like evolutionism, could serve ideological agendas.

### 3. American Diffusionism (Moderate): Age-Area Hypothesis

**Main Proponent:** Clark Wissler

**The Theory:**

Cultural traits spread outward from centers of origin like ripples in a pond:
- **Center:** Where trait originated; most cultural complexity
- **Age-Area:** Geographic extent correlates with age (older traits spread further)
- **Marginal areas:** Preserve older traits; center has newer innovations

**Method:**
1. Map distribution of cultural traits
2. Identify centers (maximum trait concentration)
3. Infer age from geographic spread
4. Reconstruct culture history

> **Example: Plains Indian Culture**
>
> Wissler mapped Plains Indian cultural traits:
> - Horse complex (relatively recent, limited spread)
> - Tipi (widespread, therefore older)
> - Certain kinship patterns (very widespread, therefore ancient)
>
> Used distribution to infer relative chronology and diffusion routes.

**Contributions:**

- More empirically grounded than European diffusionism
- Combined with actual fieldwork (unlike armchair evolutionists)
- Recognized limitations (diffusion AND independent invention both occur)
- Laid groundwork for culture area concept

**Problems:**

- Age-area correlation isn't reliable (some traits spread fast, others slowly)
- Doesn't account for traits dying out in some areas
- Centers may shift over time
- Independent invention can create similar distributions

## Franz Boas: Diffusion Within Historical Particularism

While not primarily a diffusionist, Franz Boas used diffusion to attack evolutionism:

### Boas's Argument:

**1. Similarities Can Mean:**
- Independent invention (convergent evolution)
- Diffusion (historical contact)
- Both

**2. You Can't Assume:**
- Don't assume all similarities are evolutionary stages
- Don't assume all similarities are diffusion
- Need actual historical evidence

**3. Each Culture Has Unique History:**
- Mix of local inventions and borrowed traits
- Historical particularism—understand specific histories, not universal laws

> **Example: Northwest Coast Potlatch**
>
> Evolutionists saw potlatch as a stage of economic development.
>
> Boas showed:
> - Potlatch varied significantly between groups
> - Some aspects diffused, others invented locally
> - Historical changes tracked specific events (fur trade, population changes)
> - Can't fit into universal evolutionary scheme
>
> Understanding required knowing specific history, not applying general laws.

### Boas's Methodology:

**Demand Evidence:**
- Linguistic connections prove historical relationship
- Archaeological sequences show actual chronology
- Documented trade routes show contact possibilities
- Don't speculate without evidence

**This approach:**
- More rigorous than extreme diffusionism
- More empirically grounded than evolutionism
- But also more modest in claims
- Couldn't produce grand theories of human history

## The Diffusion vs. Independent Invention Debate

### Arguments for Diffusion:

**1. Humans Are Imitators:**
Given a choice between hard invention and easy borrowing, people borrow.

**2. Historical Evidence:**
We know cultures in contact share traits (Latin alphabet, Buddhism, Islam all spread widely).

**3. Complexity:**
Very complex inventions (writing, metallurgy) were probably invented few times and spread.

**4. Geographic Patterns:**
Traits cluster geographically, suggesting spread from centers.

### Arguments for Independent Invention:

**1. Limited Possibilities:**
Some problems have limited solutions (containers need bottoms, shelters need roofs). Similar solutions don't prove contact.

**2. Basic Human Needs:**
All societies need food, shelter, social order. Similar needs produce similar solutions.

**3. Parallel Development:**
Writing invented independently at least 3 times (Mesopotamia, China, Mesoamerica). Agriculture invented independently in multiple centers.

**4. Psychological Unity:**
Similar human cognition produces similar cultural patterns.

### The Modern View: Both Happen

Contemporary anthropology recognizes:

**Independent Invention Occurs:**
- Agriculture in multiple centers (Fertile Crescent, China, Mesoamerica, Andes, West Africa)
- Writing systems (Mesopotamia, China, Mesoamerica)
- Metallurgy in Old and New Worlds
- Similar myths (flood myths may reflect common human experiences)

**Diffusion is Widespread:**
- Most cultural traits spread more than they're invented
- Trade, migration, and conquest carry ideas
- Historical linguistics and archaeology prove specific diffusions

**The Key:**
Need actual evidence of contact (archaeology, linguistics, historical records) to claim diffusion. Can't just assume similarity means diffusion.

## Case Studies: Applying Diffusion Theory

### Case 1: Sweet Potato in Polynesia

**The Mystery:**
Sweet potato is native to South America. But Polynesians had sweet potatoes before European contact. How?

**Possible Explanations:**

**1. Pre-Columbian Contact:**
Polynesians reached South America, got sweet potatoes, brought them back. (Diffusion)

**2. South Americans Reached Pacific:**
Indigenous South Americans sailed to Polynesia with sweet potatoes. (Diffusion)

**3. Natural Dispersal:**
Sweet potatoes floated across ocean, happened to land on islands, happened to be viable. (Not diffusion, but not independent invention either)

**Evidence:**
- Linguistic: Polynesian word for sweet potato (kumara) similar to some South American words (kumar, cumar)
- Genetic: Sweet potato DNA shows South American origin
- Chronology: Appeared in Polynesia ~1000 CE

**Conclusion:** Most likely pre-Columbian contact between Polynesia and South America, though exact mechanism debated.

**Lesson:** When you have clear evidence of diffusion (genetic, linguistic), it's compelling. Without such evidence, don't assume it.

### Case 2: Pyramids

**The Similarity:**
Pyramids in Egypt, Mesopotamia (ziggurats), Mesoamerica (Maya, Aztec), and elsewhere.

**Diffusionist Claim:**
All pyramids prove ancient contact.

**Independent Invention Claim:**
Pyramids are obvious solution to building tall structures with limited technology.

**Evidence Analysis:**

**Against Diffusion:**
- **Chronology:** Egyptian pyramids (2600 BCE) much older than Mesoamerican (starting ~1000 BCE, peaking later)
- **Function:** Egyptian (tombs), Mesopotamian (temple platforms), Mesoamerican (temple platforms and tombs)—different purposes
- **Construction:** Vastly different building techniques, materials, styles
- **Cultural context:** Completely different religious and political systems
- **No evidence of contact:** No artifacts, no linguistic connections, no genetic evidence

**For Independent Invention:**
- Pyramids are stable, monumental, require simple technology
- Similar form, different everything else
- Multiple independent centers of pyramid building (Egypt, Nubia, Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica all separate)

**Conclusion:** Independent invention—pyramids are a fairly obvious architectural form that multiple societies developed independently.

**Lesson:** Superficial similarity doesn't prove contact. Need evidence of actual connection.

### Case 3: Metallurgy

**The Question:**
Bronze metallurgy appears in Old World (Mesopotamia ~3300 BCE, spreading to Europe, Asia, Africa). New World had copper and gold working but not bronze. Independent or diffusion?

**Evidence:**

**Old World Bronze:**
- Clear diffusion pattern across Eurasia
- Trade routes connect centers
- Shared techniques and forms
- Linguistic and archaeological evidence of spread

**New World Metal Working:**
- Independent development (South America ~1000 BCE)
- Different techniques and alloys
- No evidence of Old World contact
- Later development of bronze in Andes (~500 CE)

**Conclusion:** Old World metallurgy spread by diffusion. New World metal working was independent invention.

**Lesson:** Both processes happen. Need to evaluate each case on evidence.

## Why Diffusionism Declined

### The Problems:

**1. Overreach:**
Extreme diffusionists (especially British school) made wild claims without evidence.

**2. Lack of Chronology:**
Without reliable dating, diffusion reconstructions were speculative.

**3. Ignoring Independent Invention:**
Assumed all similarity meant diffusion.

**4. Racism:**
Often assumed "primitive" peoples couldn't invent, could only borrow from "advanced" cultures.

**5. Can't Explain Everything:**
Diffusion explains similarities but not cultural diversity, change, or local adaptations.

### The Shift:

By 1930s, anthropology moved away from diffusionism toward:

**Functionalism (Britain):**
- How do societies work right now?
- Don't speculate about unknowable history
- Study living societies systematically

**Historical Particularism (America):**
- Each culture has unique history
- Combine diffusion, invention, and local development
- Need actual evidence for historical claims

**Structuralism (France, later):**
- Universal mental structures produce similarities
- Deep structures beneath surface diversity

## Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

### What Diffusionism Got Right:

**1. Contact Matters:**
Cultures don't develop in isolation. Trade, migration, conquest shape cultures profoundly.

**2. Historical Connections:**
Many cultural similarities DO reflect historical relationships. Linguistics and archaeology prove this.

**3. Geographic Patterns:**
Mapping cultural trait distributions reveals historical processes.

**4. Anti-Evolutionism:**
Diffusionism helped demolish unilineal evolution by showing similarities don't mean same evolutionary stage.

### Contemporary Applications:

**Globalization Studies:**
Diffusion theory helps understand how:
- Technologies spread (mobile phones, social media)
- Cultural practices globalize (fast food, pop music, democracy)
- Ideas and movements travel (environmentalism, feminism)

**Archaeological Interpretation:**
Archaeologists use diffusion concepts to explain:
- Spread of agriculture
- Technology transfer (metallurgy, pottery styles)
- Trade networks
- Empire expansion

**Linguistic Anthropology:**
Language families prove historical connections—languages diffuse as people migrate and interact.

**World Systems Theory:**
Modern understanding of global economic and cultural flows builds on diffusion insights while adding analysis of power and inequality.

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** How do you determine whether a similarity between cultures reflects diffusion, independent invention, or coincidence?

**Question 2:** In today's globalized world, is almost everything diffusion? Or is there still independent cultural creation?

**Question 3:** When cultural traits spread, do they stay the same or transform? Think of examples.

**Question 4:** Why were diffusionists often as racist as evolutionists, despite offering a different theory?

**Question 5:** Can diffusion explain why some societies adopt foreign practices eagerly while others resist?

**Remember:** Diffusionism's core insight remains valid—cultures influence each other through contact. But extreme diffusionism (everything comes from one source) was wrong. The truth is messy: lots of diffusion, some independent invention, constant mixing and transformation. Understanding cultural change requires knowing both processes and having actual evidence, not just speculation.
