# Language in Social Context: Sociolinguistics and Identity

---

## Sociolinguistics: Language as Social Practice

### What Is Sociolinguistics?

**Definition:**
- Study of language in society
- How social factors shape language use
- How language shapes social reality

**Key Insight:**
- Language is not uniform
- Varies by:
  - Region (dialect)
  - Class, education
  - Gender, age
  - Ethnicity
  - Context, audience

**Linguistic Anthropology Focus:**
- Meaning in context
- Language ideologies
- Identity construction
- Power relations

---

## Language Variation

### Dialects and Registers

**Dialect:**
- Regional or social variety
- Phonology, grammar, vocabulary
- Mutual intelligibility (usually)

**Standard vs. Non-Standard:**
- "Standard" = prestige variety
- Not linguistically superior (ideology!)
- Often: dialect of powerful group

**Example: African American Vernacular English (AAVE)**

**Features:**
- Copula deletion: "She smart" (is optional)
- Habitual "be": "She be working" (regularly/habitually)
- Negation: "He don't know nothing" (negative concord)

**Linguistic Status:**
- Systematic, rule-governed (not "broken English")
- William Labov (1960s): proved AAVE = legitimate variety

**Social Status:**
- Stigmatized (education, employment)
- Language ideology (not linguistic fact)

---

## William Labov: New York City

### Pioneering Sociolinguistics

**Study (1960s):**
- Department stores (social class)
- Saks (high), Macy's (middle), S. Klein (low, now defunct)

**Variable:**
- Post-vocalic /r/ (r-lessness)
- "Fourth floor" → [fɔːθ flɔː] vs. [fɔrθ flɔr]
- Prestige: r-ful (historically, non-rhotic was prestige; shift)

**Method:**
- Asked salespeople: "Where are the women's shoes?"
- Answer: "Fourth floor"
- Pretend not to hear: "Excuse me?"
- Careful speech (second time)

**Findings:**
- Saks: most r-ful
- S. Klein: least r-ful
- Macy's: intermediate
- Careful speech: more r-ful (all classes)

**Implication:**
- Class stratification (linguistic)
- Style-shifting (awareness, prestige)

## Penelope Eckert: Jocks and Burnouts

### Adolescent Identity

**Study (1980s):**
- Detroit suburban high school
- Two groups:
  - **Jocks:** school-oriented, middle-class, mainstream
  - **Burnouts:** working-class, reject school, urban-oriented

**Linguistic Variables:**
- Vowel pronunciation (Northern Cities Shift)
- Negative concord

**Findings:**
- **Burnouts:** More urban features (advanced shift)
- **Jocks:** More conservative (resist shift)
- Identity > class (though correlated)
- Style as social practice

**Key Insight:**
- Adolescents actively construct identity through language
- Not passive reflection of background

---

## Language and Gender

### Sociolinguistic Patterns

**Robin Lakoff (1975):**
- *Language and Woman's Place*
- Women's speech (claimed):
  - Tag questions: "It's nice, isn't it?"
  - Hedges: "sort of," "I think"
  - Polite forms
  - Rising intonation (declaratives sound like questions)

**Critique:**
- Overgeneralized
- Deficit model (women's speech = weak)
- Context matters

**Deborah Tannen (1990):**
- *You Just Don't Understand*
- Gender communication styles (different cultures)
- Men: report talk (information, status)
- Women: rapport talk (connection, support)

**Critique:**
- Binary (men/women)
- Ignores diversity within genders
- Essentializing

**Current View:**
- Gender = performance (Judith Butler)
- Language constructs gender (not just reflects)
- Variation within genders > between

---

## Language and Ethnicity

### Marking Ethnic Identity

**Code:**
- Linguistic variety tied to ethnic group
- Boundary marker

**Example: Chicano English**
- Mexican American community (US)
- Not Spanish (it's English)
- Distinct features (phonology, prosody)
- Identity marker (solidarity)

**Example: Hispanic English (Miami)**
- Cuban American
- Bilingual influence (Spanish ↔ English)
- Local variety

**Example: Korean American Code-Switching**
- Los Angeles
- English + Korean
- Style, identity

---

## Code-Switching

### Mixing Languages

**Definition:**
- Alternation between languages/varieties (within conversation, sentence)

**Types:**

**Intersentential:**
- Between sentences
- "I went to the store. Y luego fui a casa." (and then I went home)

**Intrasentential:**
- Within sentence
- "I'm going to el mercado." (the market)

**Tag-Switching:**
- Tags from one language
- "You know, es verdad." (it's true)

**Motivations:**

**Situational:**
- Topic, audience (e.g., Spanish at home, English at work)

**Metaphorical:**
- Signal meaning (solidarity, authority)
- "We" vs. "they" codes

**Not Random:**
- Grammatical constraints (Poplack: equivalence constraint)
- Skilled practice (bilingual competence)

---

## Bilingualism and Multilingualism

### Multiple Languages

**Worldwide:**
- More people bilingual/multilingual than monolingual
- Monolingualism = unusual (globally)

**Types:**

**Societal Multilingualism:**
- Multiple languages in society
- India (22 official, hundreds spoken)
- Nigeria, Papua New Guinea

**Individual Bilingualism:**
- Person speaks 2+ languages

**Domains:**
- Diglossia (Ferguson): High vs. Low variety
  - High: formal, education, religion
  - Low: home, everyday
- Example: Arabic (Classical vs. Colloquial)

---

## Language and Identity

### Who Am I?

**Language = Identity Marker:**
- Regional (where from)
- Class (social position)
- Ethnicity, race
- Gender, sexuality
- Generation (age)
- Professional (jargon)

**Shifting Identity:**
- Code-switching
- Style-shifting
- Accommodation (converge or diverge)

**Example: LGBTQ+ Language**
- "Gayspeak," "lavender language"
- Markers (lexical, prosodic)
- In-group solidarity
- But: Diversity within community (stereotypes problematic)

**Example: Youth Language**
- Slang (generational boundary)
- Innovation
- Rejection of adult norms

---

## Language Ideologies

### Beliefs About Language

**Definition:**
- Cultural beliefs about language
- What is "good," "correct," "proper"
- Who speaks "well"

**Not Linguistic Facts:**
- Ideologies (not objective)
- Serve social functions (power)

---

## Standard Language Ideology

### The Myth of the Standard

**Belief:**
- One variety = correct
- Others = inferior, corrupted

**Reality:**
- Standards = arbitrary (political, not linguistic)
- All varieties = systematic, rule-governed
- "Standard" = dialect of power

**Functions:**
- Gatekeeping (education, employment)
- Social control
- Prestige = power (not inherent quality)

**Rosina Lippi-Green:**
- *English with an Accent* (1997)
- Language subordination (ideology)
- Discrimination (accent-based)

---

## Purism

### "Protecting" the Language

**Belief:**
- Language should be "pure"
- Foreign words = contamination
- Change = decay

**Examples:**

**France:**
- Académie Française (since 1635)
- Regulate French
- Resist English loanwords
- "Email" → "courriel" (recommended, not widely used)

**Iceland:**
- Language Planning Authority
- Create native terms (neologisms)
- Resist borrowing
- Example: "computer" → *tölva* (number prophetess)

**Reality:**
- All languages change, borrow
- Purism = ideology (not linguistics)
- Often nationalist

---

## Mock Spanish

### Appropriation and Stereotype

**Jane Hill:**
- Mock Spanish (US)
- Non-Latinos using Spanish words (jokingly)
- "No problemo," "hasta la vista, baby"
- Mispronunciations (exaggerated accents)

**Function:**
- Covert racism
- Reinforces stereotypes (lazy, comic)
- Appropriation (without respect)
- Whites sound "cosmopolitan," Latinos = marked

**Harm:**
- Trivializes language
- Perpetuates inequality

---

## Language and Power

### Hegemony

**Language = Power:**
- Who speaks "correctly" = who has power
- Imposing standard = imposing dominance

**Pierre Bourdieu:**
- Linguistic capital
- Prestige varieties = symbolic capital
- Valued in linguistic marketplace (jobs, education)
- Unequal distribution

**Example: Education**
- Standard English required
- Non-standard speakers disadvantaged
- "Achievement gap" = language ideology gap?

---

## Linguistic Profiling

### Discrimination by Voice

**John Baugh:**
- Housing discrimination (US)
- Phone calls (inquire about apartments)
- Same person, different accents:
  - Standard American English
  - African American Vernacular English
  - Chicano English

**Findings:**
- AAVE, Chicano English: fewer callbacks
- "Apartment rented" (suddenly)
- Discrimination based on voice alone

**Legal:**
- Illegal (Fair Housing Act)
- Difficult to prove

---

## Language Rights

### Human Rights Issue

**Debate:**
- Is language a human right?
- Access to education, courts (in mother tongue)

**United Nations:**
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 2: no discrimination, language)
- Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007: language rights)

**Examples:**

**South Africa:**
- 11 official languages (post-apartheid)
- Recognize diversity

**Canada:**
- Official Languages Act (English, French)
- Bilingualism

**Challenges:**
- Practical (translation costs)
- Dominant languages (still favored)

---

## Literacy

### Writing and Power

**Not Universal:**
- ~15% of world (illiterate, UNESCO)
- More: limited literacy

**Oral vs. Literate Societies:**

**Walter Ong, Jack Goody:**
- Literacy changes cognition? (Great Divide)
- Abstract thought, logic (literacy enables)

**Critique (Sylvia Scribner, Michael Cole):**
- Vai (Liberia) study
- Literacy ≠ cognitive superiority
- Schooling (not literacy per se) = key
- Oral cultures = complex thought

**Literacy = Social Practice:**
- Multiple literacies (Brian Street)
- Context-dependent
- Ideological (not neutral technology)

---

## Digital Communication

### New Contexts

**Features:**
- Written (but conversational)
- Informal (texting, social media)
- Multimodal (emoji, images, GIFs)

**Effects:**

**Language Change:**
- Abbreviations (lol, brb)
- New genres (tweet, status)

**Identity:**
- Performed online
- Code-switching (platforms)

**Debates:**
- "Ruining language"? (moral panic)
- Or: Innovation, creativity?

**Netspeak (David Crystal):**
- Distinct variety (written/spoken hybrid)
- Rule-governed (not chaos)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is AAVE "bad English" or a legitimate dialect?

**Question 2:** Should everyone learn the standard, or should standards change?

**Question 3:** Is code-switching a sign of linguistic incompetence or competence?

**Question 4:** Can language discrimination be as harmful as other forms of discrimination?

**Question 5:** Does texting ruin spelling?
