# Metadata

This directory contains organizational information and cross-referencing systems for the knowledge base.

## Purpose

Metadata files help structure and navigate the anthropological content, enabling the AI to:
- Understand relationships between concepts
- - Gauge appropriate difficulty levels
  - - Navigate cultural sensitivity issues
    - - Find related topics across subdirectories
      - - Provide appropriate context for different audiences
       
        - ## Files
       
        - ### `difficulty_levels.md`
