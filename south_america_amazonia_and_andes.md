# South America: Amazonia and the Andes

---

## Introduction: Ecological Extremes and Cultural Diversity

South America presents two of the world's most dramatic environments—and two corresponding anthropological traditions:

**The Andes:**
- High-altitude civilization
- Agricultural states, empires
- Monumental architecture
- Complex political organization
- Inca Empire (best known)

**Amazonia:**
- Tropical rainforest
- Historically seen as "primitive" tribes
- Slash-and-burn agriculture
- Shamanism, kinship-based societies
- Recent discoveries challenging "pristine wilderness" myth

**These represent different adaptive strategies—but also different colonial histories and anthropological gazes.**

---

## THE ANDES

### Environment

**Geography:**
- Mountain range (Pacific coast to Amazon basin)
- Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Northern Chile, Northern Argentina
- Vertical ecology (different altitudes = different resources)

**Altitudinal Zones:**
- Coast (fishing, guano, irrigation agriculture)
- Highlands (potatoes, quinoa, camelids—llamas, alpacas)
- Eastern slopes (coca, tropical crops)

**Challenge:** How to access resources across zones?

**Solution:** Verticality (control multiple altitude zones)

## Contemporary Andean Peoples

### Demographics

**Indigenous Population:**
- Peru: 25-45% (depending on definition)
- Bolivia: 60-70% (majority)
- Ecuador: 25%

**Languages:**
- Quechua: 8-10 million speakers (Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador)
  - Inca language, survives
- Aymara: 2 million (Bolivia, Peru around Lake Titicaca)

### Ayllu: Andean Social Organization

**Definition:**
- Kin group (extended family, lineage)
- Landholding unit
- Reciprocal labor exchange
- Ritual responsibilities

**Characteristics:**
- Communal land (pasture, some fields)
- Household plots
- Endogamous or exogamous (varies)
- Authority: elders, community assemblies

**Ayni (reciprocal labor):**
- Households exchange labor
- Help with planting, harvesting, house-building
- Keep accounts (return equivalent labor)

**Mink'a (communal work):**
- Whole community works on shared projects
- Irrigation canals, roads, schools

**Continues today** (though pressured by market economy, migration)

### Verticality

**Murra's Model (John Murra, 1970s):**
- Andean communities control "archipelago" of ecological zones
- Households have access to coast, highlands, eastern slopes
- Maximize resource diversity

**Mechanisms:**
- Kinship ties across zones
- Seasonal migration
- Trade networks

**Contemporary:**
- Land reform, urbanization disrupt
- But some communities maintain multi-zone access

### Religion

**Syncretism:**
- Catholic saints merged with Andean deities
- Pachamama = Virgin Mary (sometimes)
- Mountain spirits (apus) venerated
- Offerings (coca, alcohol, llama fetuses) to Pachamama

**Pilgrimage:**
- Qoyllur Rit'i (Peru—glacier pilgrimage, 10,000s participants)
- Blend Catholic and Andean

**Shamans/Healers:**
- Paq'os (Quechua), yatiris (Aymara)
- Divination (coca leaves, guinea pigs)
- Offerings to spirits
- Healing

### Coca

**Sacred Plant:**
- Chewed for millennia (with lime, releases alkaloids)
- Reduces hunger, fatigue, altitude sickness
- Ritual offerings
- Divination

**Legal Status:**
- Legal in Peru, Bolivia for traditional use
- Illegal to process into cocaine
- International drug war targets coca cultivation
- Controversy: traditional use vs. cocaine production

**Evo Morales (Bolivia):**
- First Indigenous president (2006-2019)
- Coca growers' union leader
- Defended coca as cultural tradition

### Political Mobilization

**Indigenous Movements:**
- 1990s-2000s: Rise of Indigenous politics
- Demand: Land rights, autonomy, cultural recognition, resource control

**Ecuador:**
- CONAIE (Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities)
- Powerful political force
- Protests, national strikes
- Achieved constitutional recognition

**Bolivia:**
- Evo Morales elected 2006 (MAS party)
- "Plurinational" state (recognize Indigenous nations)
- New constitution (2009)
- Nationalize gas resources
- Aymara, Quechua official languages (alongside Spanish)

## AMAZONIA

### The "Pristine Myth"

**Stereotype:**
- Amazonia = untouched wilderness
- Sparse population, small bands
- Living in "Stone Age"
- No impact on environment

**Reality:**
- Amazonia heavily populated pre-Conquest (millions)
- Complex societies (chiefdoms, confederacies)
- Modified environment (terra preta, managed forests)
- Disease, slavery devastated populations
- "Pristine" rainforest is partly regrown after depopulation

**Recent Archaeology:**
- Earthworks, mounds, causeways (previously hidden by forest)
- Large settlements (1,000s of people)
- Challenges "tropical forest = simple societies" assumption

---

## Amazonian Ethnography: Classic Themes

### Kinship and Endogamy

**Preferred Marriages:**
- Cross-cousin marriage (MBD, FZD) common
- Creates tight-knit kin networks
- Dravidian kinship terminology

**Endogamy:**
- Marry within the group
- Small, bounded societies
- Maintain distinctness from outsiders

### Warfare

**Yanomamö (Napoleon Chagnon, controversial):**
- "Fierce people" (Chagnon's description)
- Chronic warfare (raids, revenge killings)
- Chagnon argued: warfare over women (competition for reproductive success, sociobiology)
- Critique: Exaggerated violence, ignored impacts of contact, used for deterministic arguments

**Debates:**
- How much violence is "inherent" vs. result of colonialism/contact?
- Chagnon vs. anthropologists who worked with Yanomamö later (Patrick Tierney, *Darkness in El Dorado*—accused Chagnon of unethical research, sparking huge controversy)

**Other Groups:**
- Jivaro/Shuar (Ecuador/Peru—headhunting, tsantsa/shrunken heads)
- Tupinambá (Brazil—ritual cannibalism of enemies, historical)

**Contemporary View:**
- Amazonian warfare exists but Chagnon overgeneralized
- Contact, disease, colonialism exacerbate violence
- Anthropologists must examine their own impact

### Shamanism

**Hallucinogens:**
- Ayahuasca (brew from vines, leaves—DMT)
- Used in healing, divination, communication with spirits
- Shaman journeys to spirit world

**Shaman Roles:**
- Heal illness (caused by sorcery, soul loss)
- Communicate with animals, plants, spirits
- Protect community
- Sometimes feared (can cause harm)

**Michael Harner, Michael Taussig:**
- Documented Amazonian shamanism
- Now: Western "ayahuasca tourism" (controversial, commodification)

### Animism and Perspectivism

**Eduardo Viveiros de Castro:**
- "Amerindian Perspectivism"
- Amazonian ontology: All beings (animals, plants, spirits) are "persons"
- Have their own perspectives
- See themselves as human, see others as animals/prey
- Jaguar sees itself as human, sees humans as prey
- Shamans can shift perspectives

**Implications:**
- Not nature/culture divide (Western ontology)
- Multinaturalism (one culture, many natures—opposite of multiculturalism)
- Challenges anthropological assumptions

**Philippe Descola:**
- Four ontologies: Animism, Totemism, Naturalism, Analogism
- Amazonia = Animism (all beings have interiority/soul)
- West = Naturalism (humans have culture, nature is separate)

### Gender and Body Modification

**Consubstantiality:**
- Bodies made through shared substance (food, sex, blood)
- Children created gradually (multiple inseminations)
- Kin = those who share substance

**Couvade:**
- Men "pregnant" (food taboos, rest after birth)
- Father and child share substance

**Body Decoration:**
- Paint, feathers, piercings
- Transform body, signal identity

**Gender:**
- Some groups: third gender, flexible roles
- Others: strict gender divisions
- Menstrual taboos common

## Specific Ethnographic Examples

### Kayapo (Central Brazil)

**Terence Turner, Vanessa Lea:**

**Characteristics:**
- Ge-speaking
- Circular villages (center = men's house, periphery = women's houses)
- Age-grade ceremonies
- Body painting, lip plugs

**Political Organization:**
- Chiefs (leadership through oratory, generosity)
- Factionalism

**Activism:**
- 1980s-90s: Fought Amazon development (dams, logging)
- Media-savvy (used Western imagery of "ecological Indians")
- Raoni Metuktire (chief, global spokesperson)

**Critique:**
- "Ecological Indian" stereotype (Kayapo also log, mine)
- Complex reality (not simple "noble savages")

### Yanomamö (Venezuela/Brazil border)

**Napoleon Chagnon (1960s-90s):**
- Most famous ethnography (*Yanomamö: The Fierce People*)
- Described chronic warfare
- Sociobiology (evolutionary psychology applied to culture)

**Controversy:**
- Patrick Tierney (*Darkness in El Dorado*, 2000) accused Chagnon and geneticist James Neel of unethical research, exacerbating disease, provoking violence
- AAA investigation (partially exonerated Chagnon, some accusations unproven, but ethics concerns)
- Debate rages

**Revisionist View:**
- Bruce Albert, others worked with Yanomamö post-Chagnon
- Less "fierce," more emphasis on cooperation
- Contact and colonialism exacerbated conflict

### Achuar (Ecuador/Peru)

**Philippe Descola:**
- *The Spears of Twilight* (1996)
- Animism, human-nature relations
- Warfare, reciprocity

### Matsigenka (Peru)

**Glenn Shepard, others:**
- Subsistence, shamanism
- Recent: "Uncontacted" or "isolated" groups nearby (voluntary isolation from outside world)

---

## Contemporary Amazonian Challenges

### Deforestation

**Drivers:**
- Cattle ranching
- Soy plantations
- Logging
- Mining
- Infrastructure (roads, dams)

**Rate:**
- Accelerating under Bolsonaro (Brazil, 2019-2022)
- Slowed slightly under Lula (returned 2023)
- But immense loss already

**Impact on Indigenous Peoples:**
- Land loss
- Displacement
- Disease
- Cultural disruption

### Indigenous Land Rights

**Brazil:**
- Constitution (1988) recognizes Indigenous land rights
- FUNAI (government agency) demarcates lands
- But: conflicts with miners, loggers, ranchers
- Violence against Indigenous activists

**Ecuador, Peru:**
- Varied recognition
- Oil extraction (Yasuní-ITT controversy—Ecuador, oil under rainforest/Indigenous territory)

### Contact and "Uncontacted" Peoples

**Isolated Groups:**
- Dozens of groups in voluntary isolation (avoid contact)
- Reasons: Historical trauma (slavery, disease, violence)
- Right to isolation?

**Contact Policies:**
- Brazil: "No contact" policy (FUNAI protects isolated groups' territories, avoids forced contact)
- But illegal loggers, miners invade
- Diseases deadly to isolated groups (no immunity)

### Political Organization

**COICA:**
- Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin
- Pan-Amazonian alliance
- Environmental advocacy
- Rights defense

**Local Leaders:**
- Raoni (Kayapo), Ailton Krenak (Krenak), Davi Kopenawa (Yanomami) among famous activists

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Was the Inca Empire more or less oppressive than European colonialism? How do we compare?

**Question 2:** Is the "pristine Amazon" myth harmful? Who benefits from it?

**Question 3:** Do anthropologists have a responsibility to prevent harm from their research (Chagnon-Yanomamö case)?

**Question 4:** Should "uncontacted" groups be left alone or is contact inevitable/necessary?

**Question 5:** Can Amazonian perspectivism (all beings are persons) challenge Western environmentalism?

**Remember:** South America = two major regions: Andes (high-altitude civilizations, agricultural states, Inca Empire 1438-1533, verticality, ayllu, contemporary Quechua/Aymara millions, Indigenous politics Bolivia/Ecuador) and Amazonia (tropical rainforest, historically misunderstood as "primitive," actually complex pre-Conquest, terra preta, depopulated by disease/slavery, "pristine" is myth, contemporary ethnography themes: shamanism/ayahuasca, animism/perspectivism Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, warfare debates Chagnon controversy, deforestation threat, Indigenous land rights struggles, isolated/uncontacted groups). Anthropology: Andes John Murra verticality model, Amazonia Descola/Viveiros de Castro ontological turn, Chagnon ethics debates. Both regions: colonialism devastated, contemporary Indigenous movements powerful, cultural continuity and transformation, anthropology's role ethically complex.
