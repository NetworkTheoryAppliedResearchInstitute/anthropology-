# Political Organization Types: Bands, Tribes, Chiefdoms, States

---

## How Do Societies Organize Power?

**All human societies face political questions:**
- Who makes decisions?
- How is order maintained?
- How are conflicts resolved?
- Who leads?
- How is leadership legitimized?

**But solutions vary enormously:**
- No permanent leaders vs. hereditary kings
- Face-to-face consensus vs. bureaucratic state
- Egalitarian vs. highly stratified
- Kinship-based vs. territorial

**Classic Typology (Elman Service, Morton Fried):** Four main types of political organization.

**Critical Note:** This typology has been critiqued as:
- Evolutionist (implies progression)
- Eurocentric (Western bias)
- Oversimplified (reality messier)

**But still useful:** As ideal types for comparison, not rigid stages.

## Band Societies

### Characteristics

**Small Scale:**
- 25-50 people typically
- Few hundred maximum
- Face-to-face interaction

**Subsistence:**
- Foraging (hunting-gathering)
- Mobile (follow resources)
- Low population density

**Political Structure:**
- **No formal leaders**
- **Egalitarian** (minimal hierarchy)
- Decisions by consensus
- Temporary leadership (hunting, ritual)
- No coercive authority

**Social Organization:**
- Kinship-based
- Bilateral or flexible descent
- Nuclear families, fluid composition
- Band membership changes

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Discussion, persuasion
- Avoidance (leave band)
- No police, courts, jails
- Feud between bands (rare)

### Examples

> **!Kung San (Ju/'hoansi) - Kalahari Desert**
>
> **Richard Lee's Studies (1960s-70s):**
> 
> **Political Organization:**
> - No chiefs, headmen
> - "Egalitarian to the point of anarchism"
> - Decisions made by all adults
> - Anyone can speak
> - Consensus required
>
> **Leadership:**
> - "Owners" of waterholes (hereditary)
> - But no real authority
> - Can't force anyone
> - Good hunters respected, not obeyed
>
> **Social Leveling:**
> - "Insulting the meat" (prevent boasting)
> - Share widely
> - Mock anyone who acts superior
> - "We refuse to be led"
>
> **Conflict:**
> - Talking, mediation
> - If serious, one party leaves
> - Rare violence (but happens—homicide studied)

> **Mbuti (Ituri Forest, Congo)**
>
> **Colin Turnbull's Account:**
>
> **No Chiefs:**
> - Fluid band composition
> - Decisions by discussion
> - Anyone can call meeting
> - Consensus emerges
>
> **"Molimo" Ceremony:**
> - When problems arise
> - Forest "wakes up"
> - Communal singing
> - Restores harmony

> **Indigenous Australians (Various Groups)**
>
> **Pre-colonial:**
> - Band-level organization
> - Elders respected (knowledge)
> - But no coercive power
> - Ceremonial leadership
> - Kinship governance

### Why Egalitarian?

**Explanations:**

**1. Mobility:**
- Can't accumulate (must carry everything)
- Can't hoard resources
- Prevents inequality

**2. Sharing Imperative:**
- Reciprocity essential for survival
- Hunters share (insurance)
- Leveling mechanisms

**3. No Surplus:**
- Produce only what needed
- No surplus to control
- No economic base for hierarchy

**4. Culture:**
- Ideology of equality
- Value autonomy
- Resist domination

**James Woodburn:** "Immediate-return" systems (consume immediately) vs. "delayed-return" (store, creates hierarchy).

### "Reverse Dominance Hierarchy"

**Christopher Boehm:**

**Bands actively prevent hierarchy:**
- Mock would-be leaders
- Ridicule, shame, ostracism
- Kill persistently domineering individuals (rare)
- Coalition of equals against dominance

**Not Absence of Hierarchy:**
- Active suppression
- Political achievement

## Tribal Societies

### Characteristics

**Larger Scale:**
- Hundreds to thousands
- Multiple local groups
- Descent groups important

**Subsistence:**
- Horticulture (slash-and-burn)
- Pastoralism
- Some foragers (Northwest Coast)

**Political Structure:**
- **No centralized authority**
- **Village or clan autonomy**
- Pan-tribal institutions (age-sets, clans)
- Temporary leaders (big men, war leaders)
- Segmentary lineage systems

**Social Organization:**
- Unilineal descent (usually)
- Lineages, clans
- Exogamy rules
- Kinship = politics

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Within group: mediation, compensation
- Between groups: feud, warfare
- No police or courts
- Self-help justice

### Segmentary Lineage Systems

**Political Function of Kinship:**

**Structure:**
- Nested hierarchy of lineages
- Minimal → minor → major → maximal → clan

**Political Principle:**
"I against my brother; my brother and I against our cousin; my cousin and I against the stranger"

**Fusion and Fission:**
- Unite against external threats
- Fragment internally
- Flexible, situational alliances

**Examples:**

> **Nuer (Sudan) - E.E. Evans-Pritchard**
>
> **Segmentary Patrilineages:**
> - No chiefs ("ordered anarchy")
> - Lineage segments = political units
> - Feuds between segments
> - Leopard-skin chief mediates (no power to enforce)
>
> **Political Process:**
> - Conflict within minimal lineage → elders mediate
> - Conflict between minimal lineages → minor lineage unites
> - Conflict with outsiders → major lineages unite
> - Flexibility prevents centralization

> **Somali Pastoralists**
>
> **Similar System:**
> - Patrilineal clans
> - "Diya-paying groups" (blood money collectives)
> - Segmentary opposition
> - No state (historically)

> **Tiv (Nigeria)**
>
> **Paul Bohannan:**
> - Segmentary lineages
> - Markets but no central authority
> - Genealogies determine position
> - Politics through kinship

### Big Man Systems

**Melanesia, New Guinea Highlands:**

**Big Man = Achieved Leader:**
- Not hereditary
- Earns status through:
  - Generosity (feast-giving)
  - Oratory
  - Wealth accumulation/distribution
  - Organizing exchanges (moka, tee)
  - Warfare prowess

**Characteristics:**

**Temporary:**
- Big man can fall
- Must constantly prove himself
- Competition

**Persuasion, Not Coercion:**
- Can't force followers
- Must convince, cajole
- Followers can leave

**No Institutionalized Office:**
- "Big man" = status, not position
- Dies with individual
- Sons may try, but must prove themselves

**Functions:**
- Organize production
- External relations
- Warfare
- Ceremonial exchanges

> **Example: Kapauku (New Guinea)**
>
> **Leopold Pospisil:**
>
> **Tonowi (Big Man):**
> - Wealthy (pigs, shells)
> - Generous
> - Good orator
> - Organizes group
> - Multiple tonowi compete
> - No monopoly on authority

**Marshall Sahlins:** "Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief" (1963)—distinguishes big man (achieved, Melanesia) from chief (hereditary, Polynesia).

### Age-Set Systems

**East Africa (Maasai, Nuer, etc.):**

**Age-Sets:**
- Males initiated together
- Lifelong cohort
- Move through grades together
- Political and military units

**Functions:**

**Crosscutting Kinship:**
- Age-mates from different lineages
- Creates broader solidarity
- Balances segmentary lineages

**Military Organization:**
- Warrior age-set (moran)
- Defense, raiding
- Eventually become elders

**Political:**
- Elder age-sets make decisions
- Council of elders
- Generational governance

> **Example: Maasai Age-Sets**
>
> **Initiation every ~15 years:**
> - Boys become warriors together
> - Warriors → junior elders → senior elders
> - Each set named
> - Collective identity
> - Political power when elders

### Secret Societies

**West Africa, Melanesia:**

**Poro (Liberia, Sierra Leone):**
- Male secret society
- Initiation required for full adulthood
- Political authority
- Regulates behavior
- Crosscuts lineages

**Sande (Female Counterpart):**
- Women's secret society
- Parallel authority

**Functions:**
- Political control
- Social cohesion
- Education
- Ritual

## Chiefdoms

### Characteristics

**Larger Scale:**
- Thousands to tens of thousands
- Regional integration
- Multiple villages/districts

**Subsistence:**
- Intensive agriculture
- Aquaculture (Pacific)
- Allows surplus

**Political Structure:**
- **Centralized authority** (chief)
- **Hereditary leadership**
- **Ranked society** (chiefs, commoners, sometimes slaves)
- **Redistribution** (tribute → chief → feast)
- **No bureaucracy** (direct personal rule)

**Social Organization:**
- Conical clans (ranked lineages)
- Senior lineage = chiefs
- Primogeniture (eldest inherits)
- Genealogical distance = rank

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Chief mediates/decides
- But limited coercive force
- Relies on prestige, supernatural sanction

### Examples

> **Polynesia (Tonga, Samoa, Hawaii, Tahiti)**
>
> **Chiefs (Ali'i, Tu'i, Ariki):**
> - Hereditary
> - Divine descent (mana)
> - Control land
> - Receive tribute (first fruits)
> - Redistribute through feasts
> - Organize warfare, public works
>
> **Ranking:**
> - Chiefs outrank commoners
> - Senior lines outrank junior
> - Elaborate status distinctions
> - Sumptuary laws (reserved goods)
>
> **Limits:**
> - No standing army
> - Can be overthrown (lose mana)
> - Genealogical legitimacy required

> **Trobriand Islands**
>
> **Malinowski:**
> - Chiefs (guyau)
> - Hereditary (matrilineal)
> - Receive urigubu (yam tribute)
> - Polygynous (many wives from different clans)
> - Organize kula, warfare
> - Limited coercive power
> - Generosity expected

> **Northwest Coast (Pre-Contact)**
>
> **Kwakwaka'wakw, Tlingit, Haida:**
> - Hereditary chiefs
> - Ranked lineages
> - Potlatch validates status
> - Slavery (war captives)
> - No overarching unity (village-level chiefdoms)

### Conical Clan

**Structure:**
- All descend from founding ancestor
- Senior line (chief) closer to ancestor
- Junior lines progressively distant
- Rank determined by genealogical seniority

**Functions:**
- Legitimizes hierarchy
- Every position ranked
- Succession clear (ideally)

**Timothy Earle:** Chiefdoms characterized by:
- Permanent centralized leadership
- Surplus extraction
- But no bureaucracy or state apparatus

> **Inca: ~1400-1532 CE**

### State Formation Theories

**Why Do States Form?**

**1. Conflict/Circumscription Theory (Robert Carneiro):**
- Warfare + environmental circumscription
- Losers can't flee (bounded by geography)
- Conquerors create hierarchy
- State emerges from conquest

**2. Irrigation Hypothesis (Karl Wittfogel):**
- Large-scale irrigation requires coordination
- Hydraulic despotism
- State manages water
- *Critiqued as deterministic, Orientalist*

**3. Trade and Exchange (Richard Blanton):**
- Control of trade routes
- Wealth from exchange
- Rulers tax/control commerce
- State bureaucracy emerges

**4. Population Pressure (Ester Boserup):**
- Population growth → intensification
- Need coordination
- State organizes

**5. Voluntary (Service, Sahlins):**
- Benefits of centralized leadership
- Protection, redistribution
- People consent
- *Critiqued as ignoring coercion*

**6. Multicausal (Most Contemporary):**
- No single cause
- Variable pathways
- Warfare, trade, ideology, ecology combine
- Historical contingency

**Anthropologists Today:** Skeptical of grand theories, focus on specific cases.

### Characteristics of States

**Max Weber's Definition:**
- Monopoly on legitimate use of physical force
- Within territory
- Bureaucratic administration
- Impersonal laws

**Other Features:**
- Writing (usually—Inca exception)
- Urban centers
- Monumental architecture
- Social stratification
- Specialized military
- Taxation
- Ideology legitimizing rule (divine kingship, mandate of heaven, etc.)

## Critique of the Typology

### Evolutionary Assumptions

**Problem:**
- Implies progress: bands → tribes → chiefdoms → states
- Unilineal evolution
- "Simple" to "complex"
- Eurocentric (Western states as endpoint)

**Reality:**
- Not all societies "evolved" through stages
- Some "devolved" (states collapsed)
- Coexistence (bands and states simultaneously)
- Contact and incorporation

**Eleanor Leacock, Eric Wolf:**
- Critique ahistorical typology
- Contact with states transformed "bands" and "tribes"
- Can't study in isolation

### Romanticization vs. Denigration

**Romanticization:**
- "Noble savage" (egalitarian bands)
- Peaceful, harmonious
- Ignores violence, gender inequality

**Denigration:**
- "Primitive," "savage"
- Lack sophistication
- Evolutionary inferiority

**Both Problematic:**
- Need nuanced understanding
- Variation within types
- Agency and complexity

### Alternative Frameworks

**Political Economy:**
- Focus on power, inequality, class
- How surplus extracted
- Modes of production

**Practice Theory:**
- How people navigate structures
- Agency and strategy
- Not rigid types

**Historical:**
- Specific trajectories
- Contact, colonialism, global systems
- Not isolated evolution

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are bands truly egalitarian, or does this romanticize foragers?

**Question 2:** Can modern states learn from "acephalous" (headless) political systems?

**Question 3:** Is the typology useful, or should it be abandoned?

**Question 4:** Why did some societies develop states and others didn't? Choice or ecology?

**Question 5:** Are states inevitable, or could societies organize differently?

**Remember:** Political organization varies enormously—from egalitarian bands with no leaders to vast empires with god-kings. The classic typology (bands, tribes, chiefdoms, states) is useful for comparison but critiqued as evolutionist and oversimplified. Real societies messier—many combine elements, have been transformed by contact, or don't fit neatly. Key insights: leadership can be achieved or hereditary; authority can be based on persuasion or coercion; kinship can organize politics or give way to territory; equality can be actively maintained or hierarchy institutionalized. Understanding political diversity reveals that states aren't inevitable or natural—they're one solution among many to universal political questions.
