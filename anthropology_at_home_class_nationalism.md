# Europe: Anthropology at Home

---

## Anthropology of Europe: Overview

### Turning the Gaze Homeward

**Historical Context:**
- Anthropology founded studying "exotic others" (colonial subjects)
- Europe = anthropologists, not subjects (traditionally)
- **Shift:** 1970s+ anthropology "comes home"
  - Study Western societies anthropologically
  - "Anthropology at home" (studying own culture)

**Why Study Europe?**
- Challenge anthropology's exotic bias
- Apply methods to complex societies
- Understand power (where anthropologists come from)
- Comparative (Europe = one case among many)

**Challenges:**
- Familiarity (too close, hard to defamiliarize)
- Power (studying up, sideways, not just down)
- Politics (research has immediate relevance)
- Access (institutions, elites, gatekeepers)

**Question 5:** What does it mean to study "up" (elites, power)?
