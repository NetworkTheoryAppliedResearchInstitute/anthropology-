# Ethical Principles in Anthropology: Foundations and Frameworks

---

## Ethics as Central, Not Peripheral

Unlike some sciences where ethics is an add-on (get IRB approval, then proceed), **anthropology places ethics at its core**. Why?

**Because anthropology involves:**
- Intimate relationships with people
- Power imbalances (researcher/researched)
- Potential for harm
- Representation of others
- Colonial legacy
- Vulnerable populations

**Every aspect of anthropological practice raises ethical questions.**

---

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere)

**The Foundational Principle:**

Above all else, anthropologists must not harm the people they study.

**Types of Harm:**

**Physical Harm:**
- Exposing people to danger
- Medical research without safeguards
- Unsafe field conditions

**Psychological Harm:**
- Causing emotional distress
- Triggering trauma
- Violating dignity

**Social Harm:**
- Damaging reputations
- Exposing stigmatized identities
- Breaking confidentiality
- Causing community conflict

**Economic Harm:**
- Disrupting livelihoods
- Exploiting labor
- Creating dependency

**Political Harm:**
- Exposing dissidents to authorities
- Providing information used against communities
- Serving oppressive regimes

**Cultural Harm:**
- Violating sacred knowledge
- Disrespecting protocols
- Contributing to cultural erasure

**Reputational Harm:**
- Misrepresenting people
- Stereotyping
- Sensationalizing

### Examples of Harm

> **Historical Harm: Project Camelot (1964)**
>
> US military funded anthropologists to study factors in political stability/revolution in Chile.
>
> **The Problem:**
> - Served US military interests
> - Could be used to suppress movements
> - Anthropologists as spies
> - Betrayed trust
>
> **Scandal:** Exposed, project cancelled, anthropology's reputation damaged.
>
> **Lesson:** Consider who benefits and who might be harmed by research.

> **Contemporary Harm: Outing LGBTQ+ People**
>
> Anthropologist studies LGBTQ+ community in country where homosexuality is criminalized.
>
> **Risk:**
> - If identities exposed, people could be:
>   - Arrested
>   - Persecuted
>   - Killed
>
> **Ethical Imperative:** Extreme care with confidentiality, perhaps not publishing at all if can't ensure safety.

**The Challenge:**
Sometimes harm is unintentional, unforeseen, or occurs despite precautions. Vigilance required.

### 2. Informed Consent

**People have right to decide whether to participate in research.**

**"Informed" Means:**

**1. Purpose:**
What is the research about? What are you trying to learn?

**2. Procedures:**
What will participation involve? Interviews? Observations? Time required?

**3. Risks:**
What potential harms? Discomfort? Time? Confidentiality limits?

**4. Benefits:**
What might participants gain? (Often nothing direct—be honest)

**5. Voluntary:**
Can decline, can withdraw at any time, no penalty.

**6. Confidentiality:**
How will identity be protected? Limits to confidentiality?

**7. Compensation:**
Any payment or gifts?

**8. Use of Data:**
How will data be used? Published where? Who will see it?

**9. Contact:**
Who to contact with questions or complaints?

**"Consent" Means:**
Agreement must be:
- Freely given (not coerced)
- Informed (understanding what agreeing to)
- Competent (capacity to consent)
- Explicit (clear agreement)

### Forms of Consent

**Written Consent:**
- Signed forms
- Standard in medical/institutional research
- Creates documentation

**Oral Consent:**
- Spoken agreement
- Appropriate where literacy limited
- Where written signatures feel intrusive
- Should still document (notes or recording)

**Process Consent:**
- Ongoing, not one-time
- Check in repeatedly
- Allow withdrawal at any time

**Community Consent:**
- Not just individual but collective
- Get community/tribal/organizational approval
- Respect gatekeepers

### Challenges with Informed Consent

**1. Participant Observation:**

How do you get consent from everyone you observe?
- Hanging out in public spaces
- Conversations at markets, ceremonies
- Can't get signed forms from everyone

**Approach:**
- Explain research broadly to community
- Verbal consent from those closely involved
- Respect if people ask not to be observed

**2. Literacy:**

If people can't read, written forms problematic.

**Solution:** Oral consent, witness present.

**3. Cultural Differences:**

Concept of "individual consent" may be Western.
- Some cultures: elders/leaders consent for group
- Some: consensus-based
- Some: suspicion of written documents

**Approach:** Adapt to cultural norms while ensuring genuine agreement.

**4. Changing Understanding:**

At start of research, you don't fully know what you'll find.
- Consent based on initial plan
- But research evolves

**Solution:** Process consent—keep informing, get ongoing agreement.

**5. Vulnerable Populations:**

Children, prisoners, refugees, undocumented people—special concerns.
- May not be free to decline (institutional pressure)
- May be especially vulnerable to harm
- Extra protections needed

---

### 3. Confidentiality and Anonymity

**Confidentiality:** Keep information private, protect identity.

**Anonymity:** Identity unknown even to researcher.

**In Anthropology:**
- Usually confidentiality (not anonymity—you know who people are)
- Use pseudonyms in publications
- Change identifying details
- Secure data storage

**Methods:**

**Pseudonyms:**
- Change names of people, places
- But retain general character (age, gender, role)

**Aggregation:**
- Combine data so individuals not identifiable

**Securing Data:**
- Encrypted files
- Locked cabinets
- Limited access
- Destroy or anonymize after retention period

**Limits to Confidentiality:**

**Must Disclose If:**
- Danger to self or others (suicidal, homicidal)
- Child abuse (mandatory reporting)
- Court subpoena (can fight but may be required)

**Tell Participants:** Confidentiality not absolute—explain limits.

### When People WANT to Be Named

**Sometimes:**
- People are proud of knowledge, want credit
- Community wants recognition
- Political statement (not hiding)

**Example:**
- Indigenous elders sharing traditional knowledge
- Want their names associated
- It's their intellectual property

**Negotiation:**
- Discuss preferences
- May use real names for some, pseudonyms for others
- Document wishes clearly

---

### 4. Respect for Persons

**Treat people as:**
- Autonomous agents (capable of making decisions)
- Worthy of dignity and respect
- Ends in themselves, not means to your ends

**Means:**

**Listen:**
Value their perspectives, knowledge, experiences.

**Don't Exploit:**
Don't take advantage of power imbalances.

**Don't Deceive:**
Be honest about research purposes, methods.

**Reciprocate:**
Give back—labor, resources, advocacy, whatever appropriate.

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
Respect cultural norms, values, protocols.

---

### 5. Justice and Fairness

**Fair Distribution of:**

**Burdens:**
- Who bears research costs? (time, intrusion, risks)
- Don't over-research vulnerable populations

**Benefits:**
- Who gains from research? (knowledge, publications, career)
- Should community benefit too?

**Vulnerability:**
Don't exploit people because they're accessible, powerless.

**Selection:**
Why this community? Not just convenience or exoticization.

## Professional Codes of Ethics

### American Anthropological Association (AAA) Code

**Main Principles:**

**1. Do No Harm:**
Paramount responsibility—to people studied.

**2. Be Open and Honest:**
About research purpose, methods, sponsorship.

**3. Obtain Informed Consent:**
When appropriate and feasible.

**4. Weigh Competing Responsibilities:**
To people studied, employers, funders, colleagues, public, discipline.

**Hierarchy of Responsibilities:**
1. To people studied (primary)
2. To public
3. To discipline
4. To employers/sponsors (last)

**When Conflicts:**
People studied come first.

**5. Make Results Accessible:**
Share findings with those studied.

**6. Protect and Preserve Records:**
Confidentiality, security.

**7. Maintain Respectful Relationships:**
With colleagues, students, studied communities.

### Other Professional Codes

**Different National Associations:**
- Similar principles
- Cultural variations in emphasis
- Different legal contexts

**Applied Anthropology:**
- Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA)
- Emphasis on benefiting communities

**Medical Anthropology:**
- Additional health research ethics

## Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)

### What Are IRBs?

**In US (and similar elsewhere):**
- Committees reviewing research with human subjects
- Required by institutions receiving federal funding
- Review proposed research for ethical issues
- Approve, require modifications, or reject

### IRB Review Categories

**Exempt:**
- Minimal risk
- Educational research, surveys in normal contexts
- No review needed (but still must apply)

**Expedited:**
- Minimal risk
- Standard procedures
- Single reviewer

**Full Board:**
- More than minimal risk
- Vulnerable populations
- Sensitive topics
- Reviewed by full committee

### IRB Process

**Researcher Submits:**
- Protocol description
- Consent forms
- Recruitment materials
- Risk assessment

**IRB Reviews:**
- Is risk minimized?
- Is consent adequate?
- Are vulnerable populations protected?
- Are benefits proportional to risks?

**Outcomes:**
- Approved
- Approved with modifications
- Tabled (need more information)
- Rejected

### IRB and Ethnography: Tensions

**IRB Designed For:**
- Biomedical research
- Experimental design
- Predetermined procedures

**Ethnography Is:**
- Emergent
- Flexible
- Relationship-based
- Can't fully predict

**Problems:**

**1. Can't Specify All Procedures:**
Don't know what you'll observe/ask until you're there.

**2. Ongoing Consent:**
Ethnography = process consent, but IRB wants one-time forms.

**3. Community Relationships:**
IRB focuses on individuals, but communities matter.

**4. Overly Bureaucratic:**
Forms, procedures may be culturally inappropriate.

**Anthropologists Advocate:**
- More flexibility for ethnography
- Revised IRB procedures
- Cultural sensitivity in ethics review

**But Still Comply:**
IRBs have legal authority—must work within system while pushing for change.

## Ethical Dilemmas: When Principles Conflict

### Dilemma 1: Confidentiality vs. Law

**Scenario:**
Informant tells you about illegal activity (drug dealing, undocumented immigration, etc.).

**Conflict:**
- Confidentiality: promised to protect identity
- Law: may be required to report
- Harm: reporting could endanger informant

**Options:**
- Don't ask about illegal activity
- Explain limits of confidentiality upfront
- Refuse to testify (legal risk to you)
- Anonymize so can't identify

**No Easy Answer:** Navigate case by case.

### Dilemma 2: Harm to Individuals vs. Benefit to Community

**Scenario:**
Research on domestic violence—publishing could:
- Benefit: Raise awareness, support policy change
- Harm: Expose individual victims, stigmatize community

**Conflict:**
- Public good vs. individual protection
- Community representation vs. individual confidentiality

**Navigate:**
- Heavy anonymization
- Community consultation
- Weigh harms/benefits carefully

### Dilemma 3: Respecting Culture vs. Universal Rights

**Scenario:**
Observe practice you find harmful (corporal punishment, gender inequality, etc.).

**Conflict:**
- Cultural relativism: respect their practices
- Universal rights: some practices violate human dignity
- Do no harm: intervention could cause harm

**Questions:**
- Who defines harm?
- Whose values apply?
- What's your responsibility?

**No Simple Rule:**
Anthropologists debate this constantly.

**Some Argue:**
- Intervention is cultural imperialism
- Respect community autonomy

**Others Argue:**
- Can't be neutral about suffering
- Moral responsibility to act

**Navigate:**
- Listen to voices within community (especially marginalized)
- Support local efforts for change
- Don't impose outside values paternalistically
- Recognize your limited understanding

### Dilemma 4: Researcher Safety vs. Research Value

**Scenario:**
Research in dangerous context (war zone, violent conflict, repressive regime).

**Conflict:**
- Important knowledge to be gained
- But risk to researcher

**Consider:**
- Is research worth risk?
- Can it be done safely?
- What's your responsibility to family, institution?
- Could local researchers do it more safely?

**Never:**
Sacrifice safety for data.

## Special Ethical Considerations

### Working with Vulnerable Populations

**Who Is Vulnerable?**
- Children
- Refugees, undocumented
- Prisoners, institutionalized
- Cognitively impaired
- Seriously ill
- Economically desperate
- Politically persecuted

**Why Vulnerable?**
- Limited autonomy (can't freely consent)
- Susceptible to coercion
- Unable to protect own interests
- Especially likely to be harmed

**Extra Protections:**

**Children:**
- Parental consent required
- Child assent (agreement) also needed
- Age-appropriate explanation
- Special care with sensitive topics

**Refugees/Undocumented:**
- Fear of authorities (confidentiality critical)
- Trauma (sensitive interviewing)
- Dependency (avoid exploitation)

**Prisoners:**
- Institutional coercion (truly voluntary?)
- Limited privacy
- Special IRB review required

### Researching Sensitive Topics

**Topics Like:**
- Violence, abuse, trauma
- Illegal activities
- Stigmatized identities/behaviors
- Sacred or secret knowledge

**Extra Care:**

**Informed Consent:**
Explain risks clearly—discussing trauma can be distressing.

**Support:**
Know resources—counseling, hotlines, etc.

**Flexibility:**
Allow people to stop, skip questions.

**Training:**
Be prepared for disclosures, emotional reactions.

**Self-Care:**
Vicarious trauma—researcher can be affected too.

## Advocacy and Neutrality

### Can Anthropologists Be Advocates?

**Traditional View:**
- Anthropologist as neutral observer
- Objectivity requires distance
- Don't take sides

**Critical View:**
- Neutrality is impossible (everyone has values)
- Neutrality often serves status quo
- Ethical responsibility to support justice

**Current Consensus:**
- Pure neutrality is myth
- But advocacy must be:
  - Transparent
  - Community-driven (not imposed)
  - Ethically grounded

### Forms of Advocacy

**Research as Advocacy:**
- Documenting injustice
- Amplifying marginalized voices
- Evidence for policy change

**Public Anthropology:**
- Op-eds, media
- Expert testimony
- Public education

**Activist Anthropology:**
- Participating in movements
- Organizing
- Direct action

**Applied Anthropology:**
- Working for/with communities
- Program evaluation
- Policy development

### Ethical Advocacy

**1. Community-Led:**
Support communities' own goals, don't impose agenda.

**2. Informed:**
Deep understanding before advocating.

**3. Humble:**
Recognize limits of expertise.

**4. Accountable:**
To communities, not just to self.

**5. Transparent:**
Acknowledge values, don't claim neutrality.

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** If cultural relativism says we should respect all cultural practices, does that include practices that harm people?

**Question 2:** Should anthropologists report illegal activities they learn about during research? Where's the line?

**Question 3:** Is informed consent truly possible when researchers have more power, education, resources than communities?

**Question 4:** Can anthropologists ever be neutral, or is claimed neutrality actually a political stance?

**Question 5:** If research primarily benefits anthropologist's career (publication, tenure), is this inherently exploitative?

**Remember:** Ethics isn't a separate module—it permeates all anthropological practice. Every methodological choice is an ethical choice. Every representation involves power. Every relationship raises questions of reciprocity and respect. The principles (do no harm, informed consent, confidentiality, respect) guide but don't resolve all dilemmas. Anthropologists must navigate competing responsibilities, cultural relativism vs. universal rights, advocacy vs. neutrality. No ethics code can provide answers for every situation—they require careful, contextual ethical reasoning. And fundamentally: people studied come first, before career advancement, before theoretical contributions, before disciplinary prestige.
