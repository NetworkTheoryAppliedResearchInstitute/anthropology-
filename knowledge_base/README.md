# Knowledge Base

This directory contains the core anthropological knowledge organized for conversational learning and instruction.

## Philosophy

The knowledge base is structured around **rich narratives** and **contextual understanding** rather than dry definitions. Each subdirectory contains materials that can be woven into natural conversations, allowing the AI instructor to:

- Tell compelling stories from anthropological research
- - Draw connections between abstract theories and lived experiences
  - - Provide cross-cultural comparisons organically
    - - Adapt explanations to different levels of understanding
      - - Reference real ethnographic examples naturally
