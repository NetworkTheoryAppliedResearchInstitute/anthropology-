---

## East Asia: Overview

### Region

**Core Countries:**

---

## China

### Size and Diversity

**Population:**
- ~1.4 billion (largest)

**Ethnic:**
- Han Chinese ~92%
- 55 recognized ethnic minorities (~8%, but ~100+ million people)

---

## Chinese Kinship and Family

### Patrilineal Descent

**Clan (Lineage):**
- Patrilineal descent groups
- Corporate (own property, temples)
- Ancestral halls
- Genealogies (written records, centuries)

**Classic Studies:**

**Maurice Freedman:**
- *Lineage Organization in Southeastern China* (1958)
- *Chinese Lineage and Society* (1966)
- Focused on southeastern China (Fujian, Guangdong)
- Strong lineages (land-owning, powerful)
- Segmentary structure (like Nuer, but different context)

**Regions:**
- Southeast (Fujian, Guangdong): Strong lineages
- North: Weaker lineages (historically, state more dominant)

**Family:**
- Extended family (ideal, not always achieved)
- Joint family (multiple generations, brothers)
- Patrilocal (wife moves to husband's family)
- Filial piety (*xiao*): Obedience to parents, especially father
  - Confucian value (core)

---

## Ancestor Worship

### Continuity and Obligation

**Practice:**
- Worship ancestors (deceased family members)
- Offerings (food, incense, paper money/goods)
- Graves (tomb-sweeping, Qingming Festival)
- Ancestral tablets (home altars)

**Function:**
- Maintain relationship (ancestors ↔ living)
- Ancestors: Protective (if worshiped properly), harmful (if neglected)
- Continuity (family line, across generations)

**Obligation:**
- Sons (especially eldest): Responsibility (continue family, worship ancestors)
- Son preference (strong, historically)

---

## Marriage

### Family Strategy

**Arranged:**
- Parents arrange (traditionally)
- Love marriage (increasing, modern)

**Virilocal (Patrilocal):**
- Bride moves to husband's family home
- Outsider initially (no kin support)

**Margery Wolf:**
- *Women and the Family in Rural Taiwan* (1972)
- **"Uterine Family":**
  - Woman's strategy (create own family unit within patrilineal structure)
  - Mother-son bond (central)
  - Build power through sons (eventual)
  - Counter to male-dominated lineage

---

## Village Studies

- Red Guards (youth mobilized)
- Persecution (intellectuals, "capitalist roaders")
- Chaos, violence
- Universities closed (decade)

**Anthropological Access:**
- Limited (1949-1970s, foreigners restricted)
- Opened 1980s (economic reforms)

---

## Post-Mao Reforms

### Market Socialism

**Deng Xiaoping (1978+):**
- "Reform and Opening" (*gaige kaifang*)
- Market mechanisms (introduced gradually)
- Special Economic Zones (coastal, capitalism allowed)

**Rural:**
- Household Responsibility System (de-collectivization)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** How does ancestor worship structure social relations and power?

**Question 2:** Was the Chinese Revolution a total break or continuity with tradition?

**Question 3:** Is Japan's "homogeneity" real or ideological?

**Question 4:** What are the costs of rapid economic development (South Korea, China)?

**Question 5:** Can anthropology be done without fieldwork access (North Korea)?
