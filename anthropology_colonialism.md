# Anthropology and Colonialism: Reckoning with a Troubled History

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

**Anthropology emerged during the height of European colonialism. This is not coincidence—it is cause.**

The discipline developed to understand and manage colonized peoples. Early anthropologists often worked alongside colonial administrators, missionaries, and military forces. Their knowledge was sometimes used to control, govern, and subjugate the very people they studied.

This is anthropology's original sin—and the discipline is still reckoning with it.

## The Historical Context: Anthropology Born in Empire

### The Victorian Era of Expansion

When anthropology emerged as a formal discipline in the mid-to-late 1800s, European powers controlled much of the world:
- **Britain** ruled India, large parts of Africa, Australia, Caribbean territories
- **France** colonized North and West Africa, Southeast Asia, Pacific islands  
- **Belgium** brutally exploited Congo
- **Netherlands** controlled Indonesia
- **Spain** and **Portugal** maintained American colonies
- **Germany**, **Italy**, and others competed for territories

Colonialism wasn't just political and economic—it needed **intellectual justification**. Anthropology provided it.

### Scientific Racism and Social Evolutionism

Early anthropologists like Edward Tylor and Lewis Henry Morgan developed **evolutionary schemas** ranking human societies:

**SAVAGERY → BARBARISM → CIVILIZATION**

European societies represented "Civilization"—the pinnacle of human development. Other societies were seen as earlier evolutionary stages, "primitive" peoples who hadn't yet evolved to European levels.

This wasn't presented as opinion—it was claimed as **science**.

> **Ranking Humanity:**
>
> Victorian anthropologists measured skulls, compared brain sizes, analyzed skin colors, and classified peoples into hierarchies. They "proved" that Europeans were naturally superior—more intelligent, more advanced, more evolved.
>
> This provided scientific justification for:
> - Colonialism as "civilizing mission"
> - Slavery and forced labor
> - Taking land from indigenous peoples
> - Destroying indigenous cultures "for their own good"
> - Denying rights to colonized peoples

**The logic:** "They're primitive, we're advanced. Therefore we have the right—even the duty—to rule them until they evolve."

### The Spectacle: Exhibiting Humans

One of anthropology's most horrific chapters: **human zoos** and **ethnological exhibitions**.

> **Ota Benga (1906):**
>
> Ota Benga, a Mbuti man from the Congo, was brought to the United States by missionary and anthropologist Samuel Verner. In 1906, he was **exhibited in the Bronx Zoo**—in the monkey house, alongside apes.
>
> Thousands came to gawk. Signs described him as an evolutionary link between apes and humans. He was forced to perform, shoot a bow, be photographed.
>
> African American ministers protested, horrified. Ota Benga was eventually removed from the zoo, but traumatized and unable to return home, he died by suicide in 1916.

> **World's Fairs and Exhibitions:**
>
> From 1870s through early 1900s, world's fairs featured "ethnological villages" where:
> - Indigenous peoples from colonized territories lived in recreated "native" settings
> - Visitors watched them perform daily activities
> - They were presented as primitive, exotic, educational specimens
> - This was considered legitimate anthropology
>
> Examples included:
> - Samoans at 1893 Chicago World's Fair
> - Filipinos at 1904 St. Louis World's Fair
> - Congolese at 1897 Brussels Exhibition
> - Many others across Europe and America

These exhibitions treated living human beings as objects of scientific study and entertainment—with anthropologists often involved in organizing them.

## Anthropology as Colonial Tool

### Applied Anthropology in Service of Empire

Colonial governments employed anthropologists to:

1. **Understand local systems** for more effective control
   - How do land tenure systems work? (To dismantle or coopt them)
   - What authority structures exist? (To work through or eliminate them)
   - What motivates people? (To manipulate behavior)

2. **Develop "native policies"**
   - Creating reservations
   - Designing "indirect rule" systems
   - Managing labor recruitment
   - Suppressing resistance

3. **Assess "readiness" for self-governance**
   - Judging which peoples were "evolved enough" for limited autonomy
   - Justifying continued colonial control of "primitive" peoples

> **British Social Anthropology in Africa:**
>
> British structural-functionalist anthropologists like Radcliffe-Brown worked throughout British African colonies. Their research on kinship systems, political organization, and social structure was academically sophisticated—but also useful for colonial administration.
>
> Colonial officials read ethnographies to understand how to govern through existing structures, how to extract labor and resources, how to prevent resistance.

> **Japanese Anthropology in Korea and Taiwan:**
>
> During Japan's colonization of Korea (1910-1945) and Taiwan (1895-1945), Japanese anthropologists:
> - Studied indigenous peoples for colonial management
> - Participated in "pacification" campaigns
> - Helped design assimilation policies
> - Collected cultural objects (often forcibly)

### The Salvage Paradigm

Even well-intentioned anthropologists operated within a colonial framework:

**"Salvage Anthropology"** assumed indigenous cultures were "vanishing" and must be documented before disappearance. This had serious problems:

1. **It wasn't true:** Cultures weren't naturally vanishing—colonialism was destroying them
2. **It was passive:** Documenting destruction rather than resisting it
3. **It was extractive:** Taking knowledge while cultures were being eliminated
4. **It treated cultures as dead:** Even when people were very much alive

> **Example:** Anthropologists rushed to document "authentic" indigenous practices while:
> - Colonial governments banned indigenous languages
> - Missionaries destroyed religious practices
> - Land was seized forcing people into wage labor
> - Children were taken to boarding schools
>
> Anthropologists preserved knowledge *about* cultures while those cultures were being actively destroyed—often without opposing the destruction.

### Skull Collection and Grave Robbing

The most literal form of extraction:

> **Physical Anthropology's Dark History:**
>
> 19th and early 20th-century physical anthropologists:
> - Robbed graves to collect indigenous remains
> - Measured skulls to "prove" racial hierarchies
> - Created museum collections of human bodies without consent
> - Sent remains to universities and museums in Europe and America
>
> **Consequences:**
> - Thousands of indigenous ancestors desecrated
> - Sacred burial practices violated
> - Remains displayed in museums as specimens
> - Scientific racism legitimized through physical evidence

> **Saartjie Baartman:**
>
> Saartjie Baartman, a Khoikhoi woman from South Africa, was exhibited across Europe in the early 1800s as the "Hottentot Venus." After her death in 1815:
> - Her body was dissected
> - Her skeleton, preserved brain, and genitals were displayed in Paris's Musée de l'Homme
> - She remained on display until 1974
> - South Africa requested return of her remains in 1994
> - France finally returned them in 2002—187 years after her death

## Critical Turning Points: Anthropology Confronts Itself

### Franz Boas: Anti-Racist Intervention

Not all early anthropology was complicit. **Franz Boas** used anthropology as a weapon against racism:

**Boas's Arguments (1900s-1940s):**
- Race is a biological concept, culture is learned—don't confuse them
- No cultural hierarchy exists; cultures are different adaptations, not evolutionary stages
- "Primitive" peoples have complex, sophisticated cultures
- Cultural traits result from specific histories, not evolutionary level
- Scientific racism is bad science based on prejudice

> **Boas's Students:**
>
> Boas trained a generation of anthropologists who fought racism:
> - **Ruth Benedict:** Argued against Nazi racial science
> - **Margaret Mead:** Challenged assumptions about gender and "human nature"
> - **Zora Neale Hurston:** Documented African American culture with respect and sophistication
> - **Melville Herskovits:** Demonstrated complexity of African cultures against racist stereotypes

Boas didn't end anthropology's colonial complicity—but he created an anti-racist tradition within the discipline.

### 1960s-70s: Radical Critique from Within

As colonialism formally ended and Civil Rights movements challenged racism, anthropologists began seriously questioning their discipline:

> **Dell Hymes (1969) - "Reinventing Anthropology":**
>
> Hymes assembled radical anthropologists who asked:
> - Why do anthropologists study the powerless, not the powerful?
> - Why is anthropological knowledge controlled by Western universities?
> - Why do communities studied receive so little benefit?
> - Can anthropology be decolonized, or is it inherently colonial?

> **Kathleen Gough (1968) - "New Proposals for Anthropologists":**
>
> Gough challenged anthropology to:
> - Study colonialism and imperialism, not just colonized peoples
> - Examine Western institutions with the same rigor
> - Make knowledge accessible to those studied
> - Support liberation movements
> - Question who anthropology serves

> **Talal Asad (1973) - "Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter":**
>
> Asad's edited volume examined how:
> - Colonialism shaped what anthropologists studied
> - Anthropological knowledge served colonial power
> - The end of formal colonialism didn't end these dynamics
> - Anthropology's structure still reflects colonial origins

### 1980s: The Writing Culture Debates

**"Writing Culture" (1986)** raised new questions:

**The Central Problem:** Anthropologists claim to represent others' lives and cultures. But:
- How can Western anthropologists represent non-Western peoples?
- Who has authority to speak for whom?
- Don't ethnographies tell us as much about the anthropologist as the people studied?
- Is objective representation even possible?

**James Clifford's Critique:**
- Ethnographies are literary constructions, not transparent windows
- The anthropologist's perspective and power shape what's written
- "Giving voice" to others can actually silence them by filtering through anthropologist's interpretation
- Traditional ethnography is a colonial form—the Western expert explaining the exotic Other

**Feminist and Postcolonial Responses:**
- Lila Abu-Lughod: Writing about culture can essentialize and diminish people
- Ruth Behar: Need vulnerability and self-reflection in ethnography
- Kirin Narayan: Insider/outsider boundary is more complex than assumed

## Contemporary Reckoning: Decolonizing Anthropology

### Indigenous Anthropology

> **Vine Deloria Jr.'s Devastating Critique (1969):**
>
> Deloria, a Standing Rock Sioux scholar, wrote *Custer Died for Your Sins*, with a chapter called "Anthropologists and Other Friends":
>
> **"Indians have been cursed above all other people in history. Indians have anthropologists."**
>
> His critique:
> - Anthropologists treated Native peoples as objects, not subjects
> - They extracted knowledge without giving back
> - Their careers advanced while communities remained impoverished
> - They claimed expertise about Native cultures while actual Native people were ignored
> - Anthropological knowledge often harmed Native peoples (undermining land claims, cultural appropriation)

**The Indigenous Response:**
Indigenous scholars developed their own frameworks:

> **Linda Tuhiwai Smith - "Decolonizing Methodologies" (1999):**
>
> Smith, a Maori scholar, argued research on indigenous peoples has been:
> - **Extractive:** Taking knowledge away
> - **Exploitative:** Benefiting researchers, not communities
> - **Damaging:** Used to justify dispossession and assimilation
>
> **Decolonized research must:**
> - Be accountable to communities
> - Serve community-defined goals
> - Respect indigenous knowledge systems
> - Include indigenous people as researchers and decision-makers
> - Recognize indigenous data sovereignty

### Repatriation Movements

After decades of struggle, indigenous communities are reclaiming what was taken:

> **NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 1990):**
>
> U.S. law requiring museums and institutions to:
> - Inventory all Native American remains and objects
> - Notify affiliated tribes
> - Repatriate remains and sacred objects when requested
>
> **Results:**
> - Thousands of ancestors returned for proper burial
> - Sacred objects returned to communities
> - Museums forced to reckon with how collections were obtained

> **International Repatriation:**
>
> Similar demands worldwide:
> - Maori demand return of tattooed heads from museums
> - Aboriginal Australians reclaim ancestors from collections
> - African nations seek return of looted cultural treasures
> - Pacific islanders reclaim sacred objects

But repatriation is incomplete and ongoing—many institutions resist returning items.

### Collaborative and Community-Based Research

New models challenge extractive research:

**Participatory Action Research:**
- Communities define research questions
- Community members participate as researchers
- Results serve community needs
- Knowledge stays with community

**Collaborative Ethnography:**
- Shared authority in research design
- Co-writing and co-analysis
- Community approval before publication
- Accountability to those studied

> **Example - Zuni Collaboration:**
>
> Instead of anthropologists studying Zuni people as objects, Zuni Cultural Resource Enterprise works with carefully selected researchers who:
> - Must receive community approval
> - Work under Zuni oversight
> - Share results with community first
> - Respect what should remain private
> - Acknowledge Zuni intellectual property

### Institutional Changes

Anthropology is slowly changing:

**Professional Ethics:**
- AAA (American Anthropological Association) code emphasizes:
  - Primary responsibility to people studied
  - Do no harm
  - Informed consent
  - Right of communities to refuse research
  - Protection of privacy

**Academic Shifts:**
- More indigenous and BIPOC anthropologists
- Critical examination of discipline's history
- Decolonial theory in training
- Recognition of indigenous scholars and knowledge systems
- Questioning what knowledge should be public

**But significant problems remain:**
- Anthropology is still dominated by white scholars from wealthy countries
- Elite Western universities still control the discipline
- Academic careers still depend on publication, not community benefit
- Colonial extraction patterns continue in new forms

---

## Ongoing Colonial Dynamics

### Neo-colonialism in Anthropology

Even with good intentions, colonial dynamics persist:

**Academic Gatekeeping:**
- Western journals control what counts as knowledge
- English dominates global scholarship
- Non-Western scholars must conform to Western academic standards
- Local knowledge often dismissed as unscientific

**Extractive Research Relationships:**
- Researchers from wealthy countries study poor countries
- Knowledge flows to Western universities
- Communities receive little benefit
- Careers built on others' knowledge

**Who Studies Whom?**
- Western anthropologists study non-Western societies (common)
- Non-Western anthropologists studying non-Western societies (less common)
- Non-Western anthropologists studying Western societies (rare)
- This inequality reflects ongoing colonial power

### The Aid Industrial Complex

Anthropologists working in international development and NGOs face new ethical challenges:

**Development as New Colonialism?**
- Wealthy countries defining what "development" means
- Imposing Western models of progress
- Creating dependency on aid
- Undermining local institutions

**Anthropology's Role:**
- Some anthropologists critique destructive development
- Others work within development, trying to make it more culturally appropriate
- Tension between earning living and principles

---

## Different National Traditions

Colonialism shaped anthropology differently worldwide:

**British Social Anthropology:**
- Deeply embedded in British colonial administration
- Focused on African colonies particularly
- Structural-functionalism suited colonial management
- Post-colonial anthropology has reckoned with this legacy

**French Anthropology:**
- Also tied to French colonial empire
- Different theoretical traditions (structuralism)
- Slower reckoning with colonial past
- Still influential in former French colonies

**American Anthropology:**
- Tied to internal colonialism (Native Americans)
- Also involved in Pacific, Latin America
- Four-field tradition partly from studying indigenous peoples
- Different ethical reckoning around indigenous rights

**Japanese Anthropology:**
- Colonial anthropology in Korea, Taiwan, Micronesia
- Post-WWII shift but incomplete reckoning
- Complex relationship with Asian anthropology

## Can Anthropology Be Decolonized?

### The Radical Question

Some argue anthropology is inherently colonial:
- Founded to serve empire
- Based on studying "Others"
- Structured around Western knowledge systems
- Cannot escape its origins

**Should anthropology end?**

Or can it transform into something genuinely non-colonial?

### The Reform Position

Others argue anthropology can be redeemed through:
- Critical self-examination
- Centering indigenous and Global South voices
- Community-controlled research
- Using anthropology to fight injustice
- Challenging power, not serving it

### What Genuine Decolonization Requires

**Epistemic Decolonization:**
- Recognizing indigenous knowledge systems as valid
- Not just studying but learning from other ways of knowing
- Questioning Western assumptions about science, truth, progress

**Structural Decolonization:**
- More BIPOC and Global South anthropologists in leadership
- Changing what questions get funded
- Where knowledge is published and stored
- Who benefits from research

**Ethical Decolonization:**
- Communities controlling their own representation
- Research serving community-defined needs
- Genuine reciprocity, not extraction
- Accountability to those studied

**Political Decolonization:**
- Anthropology supporting indigenous rights
- Challenging ongoing colonialism
- Working against structural violence
- Not claiming neutrality when justice is at stake

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can anthropology escape its colonial origins, or are they too fundamental to the discipline's structure?

**Question 2:** Who should be able to study whom? Should there be limits on who can research which communities?

**Question 3:** What does anthropology owe to the communities it has studied? How can those debts be repaid?

**Question 4:** Is it possible to study others respectfully, or does the research relationship inherently involve power imbalances?

**Question 5:** Should anthropologists take political stances on issues affecting the people they study? Or does advocacy compromise objectivity?

**Final Reflection:** Anthropology's colonial history isn't a footnote—it's foundational. The discipline cannot simply acknowledge this and move on. Genuine reckoning requires ongoing work: centering marginalized voices, changing power structures, questioning assumptions, and ensuring research serves justice rather than power. This work is incomplete. It may never be complete. But it's essential if anthropology is to have an ethical future.
