# Cross-Cutting Theme: Power and Inequality

---

## Power and Inequality Across Anthropology

### Foundational Concept

**Power:**
- Ability to act, make decisions, influence others
- Structural (institutions, systems)
- Relational (between people, groups)
- Symbolic (control of meaning, representation)

**Inequality:**
- Unequal distribution (resources, opportunities, life chances)
- Hierarchies (class, caste, race, gender, age, etc.)
- Reproduction (how inequality persists across generations)

**Anthropology's Contribution:**
- Shows inequality is NOT natural (culturally/historically constructed)
- Comparative (diverse forms of hierarchy and resistance)
- Holistic (connects economic, political, symbolic dimensions)

---

## Power in Kinship Systems

### Descent and Inheritance

**Patrilineal Societies:**
- Male control (property, authority, lineage continuity)
- Women (exchanged between lineages, secondary status)
- **Nuer** (Evans-Pritchard): Patrilineage = political unit, men dominate

**Matrilineal Societies:**
- Descent through women (BUT often male authority remains)
- **Minangkabau** (Indonesia): Matrilineal, but men hold political offices
- Complexity: Matrilineal ≠ matriarchal

**Primogeniture:**
- Eldest son inherits (concentrates wealth, power)
- Younger sons (dispossessed, migrate, enter church/military)
- England, Japan, others

**Inequality Within Families:**
- Gender (sons vs. daughters, inheritance)
- Age (elders vs. youth, authority)
- Birth order (eldest vs. youngest)

---

## Power in Economic Systems

### Modes of Production

**Foraging Societies:**
- Generally egalitarian (sharing, reciprocity)
- BUT: Gender inequality (men hunt, prestige; women gather, undervalued)
- Age (elders, knowledge, authority)

**Agricultural Societies:**
- Land ownership (inequality emerges)
- Landlords vs. peasants
- State taxation (extraction)

**Industrial Capitalism:**
- Class (bourgeoisie vs. proletariat, Marx)
- Wage labor (exploitation, surplus value)
- Accumulation (wealth concentrates)

**Neoliberal Capitalism:**
- Extreme inequality (billionaires vs. precariat)
- Financialization (speculation, debt)
- Austerity (cuts to public services, affects poor)

### Gift Exchange and Power

**Mauss:**
- Gifts create obligations (not pure generosity)
- Reciprocity (unequal exchanges = hierarchy)

**Potlatch:**
- Northwest Coast (chiefs compete, display wealth)
- Destroy goods (assert dominance)
- Creates followers (redistribution, but also hierarchy)

**Big Men:**
- Melanesia (accumulate, redistribute, gain prestige)
- Temporary (must keep giving to maintain status)
- Competition (rivalries between big men)

---

## Power in Political Organization

### State Formation

**Archaeological Evidence:**
- Neolithic (inequality emerges with agriculture, storage)
- Bronze Age (chiefs, palaces, tribute)
- States (kings, bureaucracy, military, taxation)

**Theories:**
- **Conflict:** States emerge to manage class conflict (protect elite property)
- **Hydraulic:** States coordinate irrigation (Wittfogel, critiqued)
- **Warfare:** Competition, conquest (Carneiro, circumscription)

**Characteristics:**
- Monopoly on violence (Weber)
- Taxation (extraction)
- Law (codified, enforced)
- Ideology (legitimation, divine right, mandate of heaven)

### Colonialism

**European Colonialism:**
- Conquest, extraction, exploitation
- Racism (justified through "civilizing mission," scientific racism)
- Indirect rule (chiefs as intermediaries, created/empowered)
- Lasting impacts (borders, economies, political systems)

**Anthropology's Complicity:**
- Studied colonized for colonial administrators
- Extractive knowledge (served empire)
- Ongoing reckoning (decolonization movements)

### Resistance

**James Scott:**
- "Weapons of the weak" (everyday resistance, foot-dragging, sabotage)
- "Hidden transcripts" (public deference vs. private defiance)

**Social Movements:**
- Civil rights, indigenous rights, labor, environmental justice
- Organized resistance (challenge power structures)

---

## Power and Gender

### Patriarchy

**Near-Universal:**
- Male dominance (most societies, historically)
- Control of women (sexuality, reproduction, labor)
- Ideology (naturalized, "women = weaker/irrational/domestic")

**Mechanisms:**
- Property (men own, inherit)
- Marriage (women exchanged, bride wealth/dowry)
- Violence (domestic, sexual, enforces subordination)
- Division of labor (women's work devalued)

**Variability:**
- NOT all societies equally patriarchal
- Some more egalitarian (foragers, some matrilineal)
- Historical change (women's movements, legal reforms)

### Feminist Anthropology

**Critiques:**
- Male bias (anthropology historically male-dominated)
- "Man the hunter" (overlooked women's contributions)
- Public/private (devalued domestic sphere)

**Contributions:**
- Gendered labor (productive AND reproductive)
- Women's agency (not just victims, active resistance)
- Intersectionality (gender + class + race + age)

---

## Power and Race

### Race as Social Construct

**Biology:**
- No biological basis (genetic variation = clinal, not discrete)
- "Races" (socially defined categories, not natural kinds)

**History:**
- Scientific racism (19th-20th centuries, Boas fought)
- Slavery, colonialism (justified through racial ideology)
- Apartheid, segregation, discrimination

**Contemporary:**
- Racism persists (structural, institutional)
- Racialization (bodies marked, differential treatment)
- Whiteness (unmarked, normative, privilege)

### Structural Racism

**Examples:**
- Mass incarceration (U.S., Black men disproportionate)
- Redlining (denied mortgages, created ghettos)
- Environmental racism (toxic sites in minority neighborhoods)
- Health disparities (maternal mortality, life expectancy)
- Algorithmic bias (facial recognition, predictive policing)

**Anthropology:**
- Dismantles race as biology (Boas onward)
- Studies racialization (how race works in practice)
- Critical race anthropology (contemporary)

---

## Power in Religion

### Theodicy and Legitimation

**Weber:**
- Theodicy (explains suffering, inequality)
- Religion legitimates power (divine right, karma, afterlife rewards)

**Examples:**
- Caste (Hinduism, karma justifies hierarchy)
- Medieval Europe (kings anointed by God)
- Prosperity gospel (wealth = divine favor)

### Religious Authority

**Specialists:**
- Priests, shamans, imams, rabbis (gatekeepers to sacred)
- Control ritual, interpret texts, pronounce orthodoxy
- Often male-dominated

**Hierarchy:**
- Catholic Church (Pope, cardinals, bishops, priests)
- Islamic scholars (ulama, interpretation authority)
- Buddhist monastics (seniority, lineages)

### Resistance Through Religion

**Liberation Theology:**
- Latin America (Christianity for the poor, against oppression)
- "Preferential option for the poor"

**Black Church:**
- U.S. civil rights (organizing, moral authority)

**Islamic Feminism:**
- Reinterpret texts (challenge patriarchal readings)

---

## Power and Language

### Linguistic Inequality

**Prestige Languages:**
- Standard dialects (associated with power, education)
- Non-standard (stigmatized, "incorrect")
- Class markers (Received Pronunciation vs. Cockney, Standard vs. AAVE)

**Language Ideology:**
- Beliefs about language (which is "proper," "beautiful," "logical")
- Naturalized hierarchy (French = cultured, etc.)

**Linguistic Discrimination:**
- Employment (non-standard speakers disadvantaged)
- Education (punished for "wrong" speech)
- Legal (courtroom disadvantage)

### Language and Colonialism

**Imposition:**
- Colonial languages (English, French, Spanish, imposed)
- Indigenous languages (suppressed, banned, lost)

**Aftermath:**
- Official languages (often colonial, favors elites)
- Code-switching (navigate power differentials)

---

## Power in Medical Anthropology

### Structural Violence

**Paul Farmer:**
- Structural violence (social arrangements harm, kill)
- Poverty, racism, sexism (root causes of illness)
- **Haiti** (TB, HIV, preventable but structural)

**Examples:**
- Lack of healthcare (poor, rural, minorities)
- Environmental hazards (pollution in poor neighborhoods)
- Stress (chronic, embodied, shortens lives)

### Medical Pluralism and Hierarchy

**Biomedicine:**
- Dominant (backed by state, insurance, prestige)
- Marginalizes other systems (traditional, alternative)

**Traditional Healers:**
- Often lower status (but widely used)
- Class (wealthy = doctors, poor = traditional)

**Reproduction:**
- Medicalization (birth = hospital, physician control)
- Maternal mortality (racial disparities, U.S.)

---

## Power in Archaeology

### Inequality's Origins

**Neolithic Transformation:**
- Foragers (relatively egalitarian)
- Farmers (property, storage, surplus, inequality emerges)
- Evidence: Differential burials, grave goods, house sizes

**State Formation:**
- Elites (palaces, rich burials, monumental architecture)
- Commoners (small houses, poor burials)
- Slaves (lowest, evidence of coercion)

**Collapse:**
- States collapse (elites vulnerable, inequality costs)
- Tainter: Complexity = diminishing returns
- Commoners (sometimes better off after collapse)

---

## Power in Urban Anthropology

### Urban Inequality

**Gentrification:**
- Displacement (poor, minorities pushed out)
- Capital (flows to cities, real estate speculation)
- Revanchism (Neil Smith, "taking back" from poor)

**Segregation:**
- Racial (U.S., hypersegregation)
- Class (wealthy neighborhoods vs. slums)
- Spatial inequality (services, schools, safety differ)

**Homelessness:**
- Extreme poverty (visible in cities)
- Criminalization (laws against sitting, camping)
- Structural (lack of affordable housing, not individual failure)

---

## Power and Environment

### Political Ecology

**Core Argument:**
- Environmental degradation = political-economic
- Elites (control best land, resources, cause degradation)
- Poor (blamed, but marginalized to fragile land, forced to overexploit)

**Examples:**
- Deforestation (cattle ranching by elites, blamed on peasants)
- Climate change (Global North emissions, Global South suffers)
- Conservation (fortress conservation, displaces indigenous)

### Environmental Justice

**Unequal Burdens:**
- Pollution (toxic sites in poor, minority neighborhoods)
- Climate impacts (poor, Global South, most vulnerable)
- Access (clean water, air, parks, unequal)

**Environmental Racism:**
- Deliberate siting (waste, industry in Black communities)
- "Cancer Alley" (Louisiana), Flint (water crisis)

---

## Power and Digital Technologies

### Algorithmic Inequality

**Bias:**
- Algorithms (trained on biased data, reproduce racism, sexism)
- Hiring (screen out minority names)
- Criminal justice (recommend detention for Black defendants)
- Credit (deny loans to redlined neighborhoods)

**Surveillance:**
- Differential (poor, minorities, more surveilled)
- Facial recognition (less accurate on dark skin)
- Predictive policing (targets Black neighborhoods)

### Digital Divide

**Access:**
- Wealthy (high-speed internet, devices, skills)
- Poor (limited or no access, "homework gap")
- Global (North vs. South, urban vs. rural)

**Platform Power:**
- Tech giants (Google, Facebook, Amazon, monopolistic)
- Control (data, algorithms, discourse)
- Labor (ghost work, low-paid, precarious)

---

## Theoretical Perspectives on Power

### Foucault

**Power/Knowledge:**
- Power and knowledge (mutually constitutive)
- Discourse (shapes what's thinkable, sayable)
- Discipline (bodies, subjects, institutions)

**Governmentality:**
- Modern power (governs populations, not just repression)
- Self-regulation (internalize norms, discipline selves)

**Applications:**
- Medical anthropology (biomedicine as power)
- Sexuality (regulation, normalization)
- Environmentality (Agrawal, forest subjects)

### Gramsci

**Hegemony:**
- Ruling class (maintains power through consent, not just force)
- Ideology (common sense, naturalized, makes inequality seem inevitable)
- Counter-hegemony (alternatives, resistance)

**Applications:**
- Cultural hegemony (dominant culture = elite culture)
- Media (reproduces ideology)

### Bourdieu

**Capital:**
- Economic (money, property)
- Cultural (education, taste, "high culture")
- Social (networks, connections)
- Symbolic (prestige, honor)

**Habitus:**
- Dispositions (class-based, embodied)
- Reproduces class (tastes, mannerisms, aspirations)

**Field:**
- Social arenas (struggles over capital)
- Education, art, politics (fields with own rules)

**Applications:**
- Class reproduction (schools reward cultural capital)
- Distinction (taste = class marker)

---

## Inequality Across the Life Course

### Childhood

**Class:**
- Wealthy (more resources, opportunities)
- Poor (nutrition, health, education, disadvantaged from birth)

**Annette Lareau:**
- "Concerted cultivation" (middle-class parenting, scheduled activities)
- "Natural growth" (working-class, unstructured)
- Outcomes (middle-class children, advantages in institutions)

### Old Age

**Pensions:**
- Wealthy (private savings, retirement accounts)
- Poor (Social Security only, inadequate)

**Health:**
- Cumulative disadvantage (lifetime of poverty = poor health in old age)

**Respect:**
- Variable (some societies revere elders, others marginalize)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is inequality inevitable in complex societies?

**Question 2:** What forms of power are most invisible and thus most effective?

**Question 3:** Can anthropology be neutral about inequality or must it take sides?

**Question 4:** How do people consent to their own domination (Gramsci)?

**Question 5:** Where do you see power operating in your own life?
