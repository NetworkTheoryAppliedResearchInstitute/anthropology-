## Mental Illness: Universal or Cultural?

**The Question:**
- Are mental illnesses universal (same everywhere)?
- Or culturally constructed (differ by culture)?

**Answer:** Both
- Some universal patterns (severe psychosis)
- But: culturally shaped expressions, meanings, treatments
- Categories vary
- "Normal" vs. "abnormal" cultural

## Culture-Bound Syndromes

## Depression Cross-Culturally

### Is Depression Universal?

**WHO Claims:**
- Depression exists globally
- Leading cause of disability

**But:**
- Expressed differently
- Meanings differ
- Category contested

### Arthur Kleinman: "Neurasthenia" in China

**"Social Origins of Distress and Disease" (1986):**

**Neurasthenia:**
- Diagnosis in China (1980s)
- Weakness, fatigue, bodily complaints
- Not "depression" (stigmatized)

**Kleinman's Argument:**
- Really depression
- Somatized (expressed bodily, not psychologically)
- Cultural pattern (Chinese don't "psychologize")

**Critique:**
- Imposing Western category?
- Maybe neurasthenia is real, distinct
- Not all distress = depression

**Debate:**
- Universalist: depression everywhere, expressed differently
- Relativist: depression Western construct, not universal

### Janis Jenkins: "The State-Constructed Nervous Person"

**Costa Rica:**
- Nervios (nerves)
- Women's distress
- Bodily, emotional
- Social causes (poverty, violence)

**Not Depression:**
- Different explanatory model
- Social, not individual pathology
- Meanings differ

---

## Schizophrenia

### Cross-Cultural Studies

**WHO Studies (1970s-80s):**
- Schizophrenia found globally
- Similar prevalence (~1%)
- Core symptoms similar

**But:**
- Better outcomes in developing countries

- Less stigma
- Social reintegration

**July Edgerton:**
- US vs. India
- India: family care, acceptance
- US: institutionalization, isolation

**Tanya Luhrmann:**
- US, India, Ghana
- Voices (auditory hallucinations) differ
- US: violent, threatening
- India, Ghana: familial, relational
- Culture shapes symptom content

### Janis Jenkins: "Schizophrenia as a Paradigmatic Illness"

**Families:**
- Expressed emotion (EE)
- High criticism → relapse
- But: cultural
- Mexican-American families lower EE
- Better outcomes

**Culture Shapes:**
- Family response
- Course of illness
- Recovery

---

## Trauma and PTSD

### PTSD: Universal or Western?

**Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:**
- Emerged 1980 (DSM-III)

**Symptoms:**

**Allan Young:**
- "Harmony of Illusions"
- PTSD = cultural construction
- Historical invention
- Not timeless

**But:**
- Trauma is real
- Suffering real
- Question: category appropriate globally?

### Didier Fassin & Richard Rechtman: "Empire of Trauma"

**Critique:**
- PTSD exported globally
- After disasters, wars
- Western experts impose
- Assumes individualized psychological trauma
- Ignores social, collective dimensions

**Alternative:**
- Local idioms of distress
- Collective healing
- Social justice
- Not just individual therapy

### Examples

> **Rwanda Genocide Survivors**
>
> - Mass trauma
> - Western NGOs: PTSD treatment
> - But: Rwandans emphasize:
>   - Rebuilding community
>   - Gacaca courts (justice)
>   - Collective rituals

>
> - Western trauma counselors

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are mental illnesses brain disorders or cultural constructs? Both?

**Question 2:** Should Western psychiatry be exported globally, or are local healing systems better?

**Question 3:** Is medicating distress helpful or harmful?

**Question 4:** Can anthropology challenge psychiatry without harming patients?

**Question 5:** How does your culture define "normal" and "abnormal" mental states?

**Remember:** Mental illness is both universal (severe psychosis found globally) and culturally constructed (expressions, meanings, categories vary). Culture-bound syndromes (susto, amok, koro, taijin kyofusho) challenge Western categories. Depression expressed differently—China's neurasthenia, Latin America's nervios. Schizophrenia outcomes better in developing countries (family support). PTSD exported globally but may not fit (Young, Fassin). Suicide rates vary, meanings differ (Durkheim's types). Spirit possession can be illness or healing. Psychiatric anthropology studies how biomedicine shapes mental health. Pharmaceutical psychiatry critiqued. Culture shapes emotions (Lutz, Levy). Autism increasingly recognized globally. Understanding mental health cross-culturally reveals how culture defines normal/abnormal, shapes distress, offers healing—mental health is always cultural.
