# Gift Theory: The Obligation to Give, Receive, and Return

---

## The Gift: Not What It Seems

**Common Western view:** Gifts are:
- Free, voluntary
- Altruistic, generous
- No strings attached
- Opposite of economic exchange

**Anthropological insight:** Gifts are:
- Obligatory
- Create debts and obligations
- Fundamentally about power and relationships
- Central to economic and social life

**Marcel Mauss's *The Gift* (1925):** Foundational text showing gifts create total social systems.

## Marcel Mauss: *Essai sur le don* (1925)

### The Central Question

**Why do we feel obligated to:**
1. Give gifts?
2. Receive gifts?
3. Return gifts?

**Mauss's Answer:** Gifts carry the spirit of the giver—to keep without returning is to keep part of the person, creating dangerous imbalance.

### The Three Obligations

**1. Obligation to Give:**
- Generosity expected
- Demonstrates wealth, status, power
- Stingy = shameful
- Prestige through giving

**2. Obligation to Receive:**
- Can't refuse gift (insult)
- Accepting creates debt
- Puts you in recipient's power
- Strategic vulnerability

**3. Obligation to Return:**
- Must reciprocate
- Failure = subordination
- Return more = competitive
- Ongoing cycle

**Together:** Create stable social bonds through ongoing indebtedness.

### The Hau: Spirit of the Gift

**Maori Concept (New Zealand):**

**Hau = Spirit/essence:**
- Objects contain hau of giver
- Hau wants to return to origin
- Must pass on gift or return it
- Keeping hau = dangerous

**Mauss's Interpretation:**
- Gift carries part of giver
- Not fully alienable (separate from person)
- Explains obligation to return

**Debate:**
- Did Mauss misunderstand Maori informant?
- Is hau really about return obligation?
- Or Mauss imposing interpretation?

**Regardless:** Powerful idea that gifts aren't fully alienated from givers.

### Total Prestations

**Mauss's Examples:** Potlatch, Kula, etc.

**Total Prestation:**
- Not just economic
- Social, religious, political, legal—all together
- "Total social fact"
- Exchange of everything (goods, services, women, rituals, courtesies)

**Shows:** Economy embedded in society—can't separate economic from social.

### The Spirit of the Gift vs. Commodity

**Gift:**
- Inalienable (attached to person)
- Creates relationships
- Ongoing obligations
- Embedded socially

**Commodity (Market Exchange):**
- Alienable (fully separable)
- Impersonal
- Transaction complete
- Disembedded

**Capitalism:** Turns gifts into commodities (alienates).

**But:** Even in capitalism, gifts persist—showing limits of commodification.

## Potlatch: Competitive Giving

### Northwest Coast Indigenous Peoples

**Kwakwaka'wakw, Tlingit, Haida, others:**

**Potlatch = Massive Ceremonial Feast:**
- Host gives away wealth
- Blankets, copper plates, canoes
- Destroy valuables (break copper, burn oil)
- Feed hundreds

**Competitive:**
- Rival chiefs potlatch
- Try to out-give each other
- Recipient obligated to return more
- Can't return = subordinate

### The Logic

**Why Destroy Wealth?**

**Western View:** Irrational, wasteful

**Anthropological View:**

**1. Status Competition:**
- Demonstrate power by giving away
- Ultimate power = destroy wealth you could keep
- Shaming rivals

**2. Validate Claims:**
- Announce marriages, inheritances, names, titles
- Witnesses legitimize through attendance
- Ritual validates social structure

**3. Redistribution:**
- Concentrates wealth, then redistributes
- Recipients benefit
- Then reciprocate

**4. Social Leveling:**
- Can't accumulate forever—must give
- Prevents extreme inequality
- Converts wealth to prestige

### Franz Boas's Study

**"The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians" (1897):**

**Documented:**
- Detailed potlatch practices
- Speeches, songs, rituals
- Exchange networks
- Competitive dynamics

**Interpretation:**
- Gift economy, not market
- Prestige through generosity
- Social structure maintained

### Colonial Suppression

**Canadian Government Ban (1884-1951):**

**Rationale:**
- "Wasteful," "anti-civilizational"
- Impediment to capitalism
- Christian missionaries opposed

**Reality:**
- Cultural suppression
- Forcing market economy
- Destroying indigenous institutions

**Resistance:**
- Continued secretly
- Cultural persistence

**Legalization (1951):**
- Potlatch legal again
- Cultural revival
- Modified contemporary forms

### Contemporary Potlatches

**Still Practiced:**
- Weddings, funerals, naming ceremonies
- Smaller scale
- Cash, store-bought goods (not just traditional wealth)
- But same logic—validate claims, redistribute, compete

## Kula Ring: Malinowski's Discovery

### The System

**Trobriand Islands and Neighboring Islands (Melanesia):**

**Two Types of Valuables:**

**Soulava (Shell Necklaces):**
- Red shell disks
- Travel clockwise around ring

**Mwali (Shell Armbands):**
- White shell
- Travel counterclockwise

**The Rules:**

**Never Buy/Sell:**
- Only gift exchange
- No haggling over kula

**Partners:**
- Establish partnerships
- Obligated to exchange
- Lifelong bonds

**Never Keep:**
- Must pass on
- Hold temporarily (months/years)
- Then give to another partner

**Circle:**
- Necklaces one direction
- Armbands other direction
- Vast network linking islands

### What Gets Exchanged

**Kula = Ceremonial:**
- Necklaces and armbands
- No utilitarian use
- Pure prestige

**Gimwali = Trade:**
- Practical goods (food, pots, tools)
- Accompanies kula expeditions
- But separate

**Critical:** Distinguish ceremonial from utilitarian exchange.

### Functions

**1. Builds Alliances:**
- Links hostile islands
- Peace through exchange
- Can't war with kula partners

**2. Creates Prestige:**
- Famous necklaces/armbands have names, histories
- Possessing temporarily brings honor
- Stories of past possessors

**3. Demonstrates Character:**
- Generosity, timing, relationships
- Strategic giving
- Build reputation

**4. Legitimates Authority:**
- Big men control many partnerships
- More exchanges = higher status

### Malinowski's Analysis

**"Argonauts of the Western Pacific" (1922):**

**Discovered:**
- Vast exchange system
- Ceremonial not economic (utilitarian)
- Social bonds through objects
- Rational in own terms (not "primitive")

**Showed:**
- Economic anthropology needs ethnography
- Can't understand from outside
- Meaning matters, not just material value

**Influence:**
- Model for studying non-market exchange
- Inspired Mauss's *The Gift*

### Kula Today

**Still Practiced:**
- Modified (cash, modern travel)
- But logic persists
- Cultural identity
- Resisting commodification

**Threats:**
- State attempts to monetize
- Tourism pressures
- Generational change

## Annette Weiner: Women's Wealth

### The Critique

**Problem with Malinowski:**
- Focused on men's kula
- Ignored women's exchanges
- Patriarchal blindness

**Annette Weiner's Return to Trobriands (1970s):**

**Discovery:** Women have separate, equally important exchange system.

### Women's Wealth

**Banana Leaf Bundles and Skirts:**
- Women produce
- Exchange at mortuary ceremonies
- Massive distributions
- Create prestige for women

**Ignored by Malinowski:**
- Visible but dismissed
- Assumed men's exchanges mattered

**Weiner's Argument:**
- Women's wealth crucial
- Complements men's kula
- Gender-parallel systems
- Mortuary distributions central

### Inalienable Possessions

**Weiner's Theory:**

**Some Things Not for Exchange:**
- Sacred objects
- Heirlooms
- Ancestral bones
- Cosmological treasures

**"Keeping-While-Giving":**
- Give some things (kula, wealth)
- Keep others (inalienable)
- Balance exchange and retention
- Identity through keeping

**Challenges Mauss:**
- Not all about circulation
- Some things must be kept
- Paradox of inalienable possessions

**Expanded Understanding:**
- Complexity beyond simple reciprocity
- Gender crucial
- Power in keeping, not just giving

## Beyond Mauss: Theoretical Developments

### Pierre Bourdieu: Strategic Giving

**"Outline of a Theory of Practice" (1977):**

**Critique of Mauss:**
- Too mechanical (A gives, B returns)
- Ignores strategy and timing

**Gift as Strategy:**
- Timing matters (don't return immediately—seems mechanical)
- Interval creates uncertainty
- More/less than received = power move
- Individual agency in system

**Symbolic Violence:**
- Gift creates debt disguised as generosity
- Recipient obligated but can't acknowledge debt
- Power through misrecognition

### C.A. Gregory: Gifts and Commodities

**"Gifts and Commodities" (1982):**

**Distinction:**

**Gift Economy:**
- Inalienable goods
- Creates qualitative relationships between people
- Reproduces social ties

**Commodity Economy:**
- Alienable goods
- Creates quantitative relationships through things
- Dissolves social ties

**Capitalism vs. Gift:**
- Capitalism = commodity production
- But gifts persist (family, friendship)
- Dialectical relationship

### Arjun Appadurai: Social Life of Things

**"The Social Life of Things" (1986):**

**Things Have Biographies:**
- Move between categories
- Gift → commodity → heirloom → gift
- Context determines status

**Commoditization:**
- Not permanent state
- Objects shift
- "Singularization" (make unique)

**Regimes of Value:**
- Different spheres
- Conversions between spheres
- Politics of value

### Chris Gregory: Savage Money

**"Savage Money" (2015):**

**Papua New Guinea:**
- Shell money
- Not commodity money
- Gift economy money
- Creates social relationships

**Shows:** Even "money" can be gift-like, not commodity.

## Gifts in Capitalist Societies

### Persistent Gift-Giving

**Even in Market Economies:**

**Family Gifts:**
- Birthday, Christmas, weddings
- Creates bonds
- Obligation persists

**Corporate Gifts:**
- Business relationships
- "Free" samples
- Build loyalty (disguised reciprocity)

**Charity/Donations:**
- "Altruism"
- But also status, reputation, tax benefits

**Organ Donation:**
- "Gift of life"
- Should be free
- But markets emerging (black market, compensation)

### Commodification of Gifts

**Gift Industry:**
- Hallmark, gift shops
- Commodified gift-giving
- But still social (not purely economic)

**Gift Cards:**
- Cash disguised as gift
- Removes personal touch
- But less awkward than cash

**Debates:**
- Are commercialized gifts still gifts?
- Or commodities wearing gift disguise?

### Hyde: The Gift vs. Market

**Lewis Hyde, "The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property" (1979):**

**Art as Gift:**
- Artists create gifts
- Art should circulate freely
- Copyright, markets corrupt gift
- Tension between gift and commodity

**Creative Commons:**
- Attempt to keep knowledge/art as gift
- Resist commodification

---

## Contemporary Applications

### Open Source as Gift Economy

**Software:**
- Linux, Wikipedia, etc.
- Programmers give code
- Reputation through contribution
- Generalized reciprocity
- Resists commodification

**But:**
- Corporations profit from free labor
- Exploitation or collaboration?

### Social Media: Gift or Extraction?

**Content Creation:**
- Users give content
- Platforms profit
- Asymmetric exchange

**Is This Gift?**
- Users give freely
- But platform extracts value
- Not reciprocity—exploitation

### Organ Markets Debate

**Gift Model:**
- Altruistic donation
- Save lives
- Can't buy/sell

**Market Model:**
- Compensate donors
- Increase supply
- Individual choice

**Tension:**
- Commodifying body parts
- Exploitation of poor (sell organs)
- But shortage kills people

**Anthropology:**
- Shows cultural specificity
- Different societies different norms
- No universal answer

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** When you give gifts, do you feel the three obligations Mauss described?

**Question 2:** Is potlatch wasteful destruction or rational social strategy?

**Question 3:** Can gifts exist in capitalism, or are they inevitably commodified?

**Question 4:** Should organ donation remain a gift, or is a market ethical?

**Question 5:** Are Wikipedia and open source true gift economies, or something new?

**Remember:** Gifts aren't free—they create obligations. The three obligations (give, receive, return) bind people together. Potlatch and kula show gift-giving as total social system—economic, political, religious combined. Mauss revealed gifts as fundamental to human society, not just economic transactions. Weiner showed women's wealth and inalienable possessions complicate Mauss's model. Bourdieu added strategy and power. Contemporary capitalism commodifies but doesn't eliminate gifts—they persist in families, friendships, art, open source. The gift/commodity tension is central to modern economies. Understanding gift theory reveals how exchange creates and maintains social relationships—fundamentally, gifts are about people, not things.
