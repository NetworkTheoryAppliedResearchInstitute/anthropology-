# Colonial Encounter and Legacies in Africa

---

## The Scramble for Africa

### Partition

**Timeline:**
- 1880s-1900s (rapid)
- Berlin Conference (1884-1885)
  - European powers divided Africa
  - No African representatives
- By 1914: Only Ethiopia, Liberia independent

**Colonial Powers:**
- Britain (largest)
- France (second)
- Belgium (Congo)
- Germany (until WWI)
- Portugal
- Italy
- Spain (minor)

**Motivations:**

**Economic:**
- Raw materials (rubber, minerals, palm oil, timber)
- Markets (European goods)
- Investment opportunities

**Political:**
- Rivalry (European powers compete)
- Prestige (empire = power)

**Ideological:**
- "Civilizing mission" (France: *mission civilisatrice*)
- "White Man's Burden" (Britain, Kipling)
- Christianity (conversion)
- Racism (scientific racism, Social Darwinism)

---

## Conquest and Resistance

### Violence

**Methods:**
- Military conquest (superior weapons)
- Treaties (coerced, deceptive)
- Divide and rule (exploit rivalries)

**Resistance:**
- Widespread (African agency)
- Armed resistance
  - Ashanti Wars (Ghana, Britain)
  - Maji Maji Rebellion (Tanzania, Germany, 1905-1907)
  - Herero and Nama Genocide (Namibia, Germany, 1904-1908)

**Herero and Nama Genocide:**
- German Southwest Africa (Namibia)
- Uprising (1904)
- German response: Extermination order (General von Trotha)
- ~65,000 Herero, ~10,000 Nama killed

- **First genocide of 20th century** (recognition)
- Reparations debate (ongoing)

---

## Colonial Systems

### Administration

**Direct Rule (France, Portugal):**
- French administration
- Assimilation (ideal)
  - Africans become "French" (culturally)
  - *Évolués* ("evolved," elite Africans)
- Centralized

**Indirect Rule (Britain):**
- Frederick Lugard (Nigeria, theorist)
- Rule through "traditional" chiefs
- "Tradition" often invented or manipulated
- Chiefs = intermediaries (colonial state)
- Divide and rule (ethnicities reified)

**Consequences:**
- "Tribes" created (administrative units)
- Ethnic identities hardened
- Chiefs co-opted (legitimacy eroded)

---

## Economic Exploitation

### Extraction

**Plantation Agriculture:**
- Cash crops (monoculture)
  - Cotton, coffee, cocoa, rubber, groundnuts
- European-owned (often)
- Forced labor (common)

**Mining:**
- Gold (South Africa, Ghana)
- Diamonds (South Africa, Botswana, DRC)
- Copper (Zambia, DRC)
- Tin, bauxite, uranium

**Taxation:**
- Hut tax, head tax (forced monetization)
- Force labor (pay taxes)
- Push into wage labor (mines, plantations)

**Infrastructure:**
- Roads, railways (built)
- **Purpose:** Extract resources (not develop)
- Interior → coast (ports)
- Limited local benefit

---

## Forced Labor

### Brutality

**Belgian Congo (Leopold II):**
- Personal colony (1885-1908)
- Rubber extraction (brutal)
- Quotas (impossible)
- Punishment: Mutilation (hands cut off)
- Deaths: ~10 million (estimates)
- **Joseph Conrad:** *Heart of Darkness* (1899, fictional but based on reality)
- Scandal (international outcry)
- 1908: Belgium takes over (state colony, reforms but still exploitative)

**French Equatorial Africa:**
- Concession companies (rubber, ivory)
- Forced labor (porters, *portage*)
- Abuses (similar to Belgian Congo)

**Portugal (Mozambique, Angola):**
- *Chibalo* (forced labor)
- Contract labor (coerced)
- Lasted until independence (1975)

---

## Apartheid

### South Africa

**Definition:**
- "Apartness" (Afrikaans)
- Racial segregation (legal system)
- 1948-1994

**System:**

**Racial Classification:**
- White, Black, Coloured, Indian (legally defined)
- Population Registration Act (1950)

**Separate Development:**

- Bantustans ("homelands," reserves for Blacks)
  - 13% of land (for 80% population)
  - Forced removals
- Pass laws (movement restricted)
  - Blacks need permits (urban areas)

**Political:**
- Whites only vote (national)
- Blacks: No political rights

**Economic:**
- Job reservation (skilled jobs for Whites)
- Migrant labor (mines)
  - Men in hostels (families left behind)

**Social:**
- Separate facilities (schools, hospitals, beaches, buses)
- Mixed marriages illegal

**Resistance:**

**Legacy:**
- Economic inequality (persists)
- Spatial segregation (townships)
- Trauma

## Missionaries and Education

### Christianity

**Spread:**
- Mission schools (primary education)
- Conversion (millions)

**Impact:**

**Positive (Argued):**
- Literacy (access)
- Western education (mobility)
- Critique of colonialism (some missionaries)

**Negative:**
- Cultural destruction (traditional religions, practices)
- Collaborators (colonial state)
- Paternalism
- Undermined chiefs (alternative authority)

**African Agency:**
- Selective adoption
- Independent churches (African-led)
- Syncretism (Christianity + African traditions)

**Examples:**
- Kimbanguism (DRC, Simon Kimbangu, 1920s)
- Zion Christian Church (South Africa)
- Aladura churches (Nigeria, Yoruba)

---

## Health and Medicine

### Colonial Medicine

**Goals:**
- Protect Europeans (tropical diseases)
- Productive labor (healthy workers)
- Control populations

**Campaigns:**

- Malaria
- Smallpox vaccination

**Coercive:**

- Quarantine, forced relocations
- Distrust (African populations)

**Medical Experimentation:**
- Africans as subjects (without consent)
- Ethics violated

**Legacy:**
- Distrust of biomedicine (persists)
- Dual systems (traditional + biomedical)

---

## Invention of Tradition

### Hobsbawm and Ranger

***The Invention of Tradition* (1983):**
- Colonial authorities "invented" traditions
- Purpose: Control, legitimize rule

**Examples:**

**British Indirect Rule:**
- Created "tribal" chiefs (where none existed)
- Codified "customary law" (simplified, rigidified)
- Ethnic identities hardened

**Ceremonial:**
- Royal tours (pageantry, invented rituals)
- Uniforms (chiefs)

**Insight:**
- "Tradition" = not timeless (often recent, political)

---

## Language and Education

### Linguistic Impact

**Colonial Languages:**
- English, French, Portuguese (official)
- Education, administration, commerce
- Elite proficiency (access to power)

**African Languages:**
- Marginalized (official contexts)
- Oral (often, no writing systems developed by colonizers)
- Some: Literacy (missionaries, Bible translations)

**Post-Colonial:**
- Language politics (which official?)
- Multilingualism (common)
- Code-switching

**Ngugi wa Thiong'o:**
- Kenyan writer
- *Decolonising the Mind* (1986)
- Argues: African languages essential (decolonization)
- Writes in Gikuyu (Kikuyu)

---

- Nkrumah (leader, Pan-Africanist)

**Algeria:**
- Violent (France resisted)
- 1954-1962 (war)
- ~1 million dead
- Independence 1962

**Congo Crisis:**

---

## Neo-Colonialism

- BUT: Economic control (former colonizers)

**Mechanisms:**
- Trade (unfavorable terms)
- Debt
- Multinational corporations (resources)
- Military bases, interventions
- Aid (conditional)

**Françafrique:**
- France-Africa relations (post-independence)
- French influence (political, military)

---

## Post-Colonial Theory

### Analyzing Legacies

**Frantz Fanon:**

- Western representation (East)
- Discourse = power
- Knowledge production (colonial)

**Achille Mbembe:**
- *On the Postcolony* (2001)
- African post-colonial state
- Commandment (authoritarian)
- BUT: Chaos, improvisation (also)
- "Banality of power"

**Mahmood Mamdani:**
- *Citizen and Subject* (1996)
- Colonial dual system
  - Urban: Citizens (civil law, rights)
  - Rural: Subjects (customary law, chiefs)
- Legacy (independent states)

---

## Reparations and Memory

### Accounting for the Past

**Debates:**
- Should colonizers pay reparations?
- Apologies (symbolic?)
- Return of artifacts (museums)

**Examples:**

**Germany-Namibia:**
- Herero and Nama genocide (1904-1908)
- Germany acknowledged (2021)
- Offered aid (€1.1 billion, 30 years)
- NOT called "reparations" (legal reasons)
- Herero/Nama: Rejected (want direct reparations, negotiations)

**Benin Bronzes:**
- Looted (British, 1897, Benin Kingdom, Nigeria)
- Museums worldwide (British Museum, others)
- Nigeria demands return
- Some returned (Germany, France, beginning)

**France:**
- President Macron (2017): Colonialism = "crime against humanity"
- Some artifacts returned (Benin, others)
- But: Limited

**Ongoing:**
- Memory (contested)
- Colonial statues (removal debates)
- Curriculum (what's taught?)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Was colonialism primarily economic exploitation or civilizing mission?

**Question 2:** How much of Africa's current challenges can be attributed to colonialism?

**Question 3:** Should former colonial powers pay reparations?

**Question 4:** Can "tradition" be invented, or must it be organic?

**Question 5:** Is neo-colonialism a useful concept or an oversimplification?
