# Functionalism: Society as Organism (1920s-1950s)

---

## A New Question for Anthropology

By the 1920s, anthropology was exhausted by debates between evolutionists and diffusionists. Both tried to reconstruct unknown history through speculation. Both produced elaborate theories with limited evidence.

British anthropologists proposed a radical alternative: **Stop speculating about the unknowable past. Study how societies work in the present.**

This was **functionalism**—perhaps the most influential theoretical framework in 20th-century anthropology. It asked: How do social institutions and cultural practices **function** to maintain society? What purpose does each element serve?

The metaphor: **Society is like a living organism**—each part (heart, lungs, liver) serves a function keeping the whole body alive. Similarly, each social institution serves a function maintaining social equilibrium.

## The Founders: Two Visions of Functionalism

### Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942): Psychological Functionalism

**Background:**
- Polish intellectual, trained in mathematics and physics
- Stranded in Australia during WWI (as Austrian citizen)
- Went to Trobriand Islands (Papua New Guinea) for fieldwork (1915-1918)
- Transformed anthropological method through intensive participant observation

**Malinowski's Core Idea: Needs and Functions**

**The Principle:**
Cultural institutions exist to satisfy basic human needs (biological and psychological).

**Basic Needs:**
1. **Biological:** Nutrition, reproduction, bodily comfort, safety, movement, growth, health
2. **Derived (Psychological):** Economic cooperation, social control, education, political organization

**How It Works:**
- Humans have universal biological and psychological needs
- Every culture develops institutions to meet these needs
- Institutions that don't meet needs disappear
- Understanding culture means identifying what needs institutions serve

> **Example: The Kula Ring (Trobriands)**
>
> Malinowski observed elaborate ceremonial exchange of shell valuables across islands:
> - Necklaces (soulava) circulate clockwise
> - Armbands (mwali) circulate counterclockwise
> - Participants gain prestige through successful exchanges
> - Complex rules govern who can exchange with whom
>
> **Functionalist Analysis:**
>
> The Kula functions to:
> - **Economic:** Enable trade (utilitarian goods travel with ceremonial items)
> - **Political:** Create alliances between islands
> - **Social:** Establish and maintain relationships
> - **Psychological:** Provide adventure, excitement, meaning, prestige
> - **Integration:** Bind separate communities into larger social network
>
> The Kula isn't "irrational primitive exchange"—it serves multiple crucial functions maintaining Trobriand society.

**Method: Participant Observation**

Malinowski revolutionized fieldwork by:
- Living in villages (not colonial compounds)
- Learning local language fluently
- Participating in daily life
- Recording everything (mundane and spectacular)
- Staying for extended periods (years, not weeks)

**His Famous Directive:**
*"The final goal, of which an Ethnographer should never lose sight... is, briefly, to grasp the native's point of view, his relation to life, to realize his vision of his world."*

**Major Works:**
- *Argonauts of the Western Pacific* (1922): Trobriand kula exchange
- *The Sexual Life of Savages* (1929): Kinship, sexuality, reproduction
- *Coral Gardens and Their Magic* (1935): Agriculture and ritual

**Malinowski's Legacy:**
- Established intensive fieldwork as anthropology's method
- Showed "primitive" practices are rational and functional
- Emphasized psychological dimension of culture
- But: Sometimes reduced complex meanings to simple needs

### A.R. Radcliffe-Brown (1881-1955): Structural-Functionalism

**Background:**
- British anthropologist, studied philosophy and psychology
- Fieldwork in Andaman Islands, Australia, Africa
- More theoretical and abstract than Malinowski

**Radcliffe-Brown's Core Idea: Social Structure and Equilibrium**

**The Principle:**
Society is a system of relationships that must maintain equilibrium. Social institutions function to maintain structural stability.

**Key Concepts:**

**1. Social Structure:**
The network of actual social relationships between people (not abstract rules, but real patterns of interaction).

**2. Function:**
The contribution an institution makes to maintaining social structure and cohesion.

**3. Social Solidarity:**
Shared values, beliefs, and practices that integrate society.

**The Method:**
- Comparative study of social structures
- Identify patterns across societies
- Determine structural principles
- Explain institutions by their function in maintaining structure

> **Example: Joking Relationships**
>
> Radcliffe-Brown observed patterns in many African societies:
> - Certain relatives (e.g., cross-cousins, grandparents-grandchildren) can joke, tease, even insult each other
> - Others (e.g., mother-in-law, father-in-law) require extreme respect, even avoidance
>
> **Structural-Functional Explanation:**
>
> These patterned behaviors function to:
> - **Reduce tension:** Joking relationships allow safe expression of potential conflict (e.g., competition between cross-cousins for same women)
> - **Maintain respect:** Avoidance maintains necessary social distance where conflict could be problematic
> - **Social structure:** These patterns map onto kinship structure, maintaining proper relationships
>
> The function isn't conscious—people don't know WHY they joke with cross-cousins. But the pattern serves structural purposes.

**Major Works:**
- *The Andaman Islanders* (1922): Social organization and ritual
- *Structure and Function in Primitive Society* (1952): Theoretical essays

**Difference from Malinowski:**

| Malinowski | Radcliffe-Brown |
|------------|-----------------|
| Psychological needs | Social structure |
| Individual and culture | Society and structure |
| Biological and psychological | Sociological |
| Empirical, ethnographic | Theoretical, comparative |
| Function = meeting needs | Function = maintaining structure |

**Radcliffe-Brown's Legacy:**
- Systematic comparison of social structures
- Kinship as structural system
- Influence on British social anthropology
- But: Often abstracted away from actual people's experiences

## Core Functionalist Principles

### 1. Synchronic Analysis

**Focus on the present system, not historical origins.**

**Why:**
- Can't know unknowable history
- How something originated doesn't explain how it functions now
- Understanding current function is achievable; reconstruction of past is speculative

**Example:**
Don't ask "How did the Kula originate?" (unknowable). Ask "What does the Kula do for Trobriand society today?" (observable).

### 2. Holism

**Every element connects to every other element; society is integrated system.**

**Implication:**
- Can't understand one institution in isolation
- Change one part, affects the whole
- Must study cultural patterns, not isolated traits

### 3. Equilibrium

**Societies tend toward balance and stability.**

**Assumption:**
- Social systems maintain themselves
- Institutions persist because they serve functions
- Change is generally adaptive

**Problem:**
This assumption underestimates conflict, power, and radical change.

### 4. Universal Human Needs (Malinowski)

**All humans share basic needs; cultures vary in how they meet them.**

### 5. Social Integration (Radcliffe-Brown)

**Societies persist through shared values and practices that create solidarity.**

## Functionalism in Action: Classic Studies

### E.E. Evans-Pritchard: The Nuer (1940)

Though critical of functionalism later, Evans-Pritchard's Nuer studies used functionalist analysis:

> **The Nuer of Sudan:**
>
> **The Question:** How do the Nuer maintain political order without centralized government, chiefs, or formal authority?
>
> **The System:**
> - Segmentary lineage system: People identify with nested groups (family → lineage → clan → tribe)
> - Relationships defined by genealogy (real or fictional)
> - In disputes: Groups unite against common enemy; split against each other otherwise
>
> **How It Functions:**
> - **Political order:** Segmentary opposition creates fluid alliances maintaining balance
> - **Conflict resolution:** Leopard-skin chief mediates (but can't enforce)
> - **Social cohesion:** Shared lineage ideology integrates separate groups
> - **Defense:** Can mobilize large groups when threatened
>
> **The Insight:** "Acephalous" (headless) systems can be highly organized. Political order doesn't require centralized authority—it can emerge from structural principles.

### Meyer Fortes: The Tallensi (1945, 1949)

**Fortes (Radcliffe-Brown's student) studied Tallensi of Ghana:**

> **Ancestor Worship:**
>
> **The Practice:** Tallensi make offerings to ancestors, consult them, blame them for misfortune.
>
> **Functionalist Analysis:**
>
> Ancestor worship functions to:
> - **Social control:** Ancestors punish immoral behavior (supernatural enforcement)
> - **Lineage solidarity:** Shared ancestors unite descendants
> - **Authority structure:** Elders represent ancestors, giving them authority
> - **Tension management:** Ambivalent feelings toward fathers (respect + resentment) displaced onto ancestors
>
> **Not about belief:** Whether ancestors "really" exist is irrelevant. What matters is the social function ancestor worship serves.

### Max Gluckman: Conflict and Social Change

**Gluckman (more critical of simple functionalism) showed:**

> **Rituals of Rebellion:**
>
> In some African societies, annual rituals allow subjects to:
> - Mock the king
> - Temporarily reverse social hierarchies
> - Express grievances openly
>
> **Function:**
> - **Safety valve:** Releasing tension prevents real rebellion
> - **Reinforcement:** After ritual, hierarchy reaffirmed
> - **Legitimacy:** King's tolerance of criticism demonstrates strength
>
> **Gluckman's Point:** Conflict can be functional—it maintains system by providing outlet for tensions.

## Critiques of Functionalism

### 1. The Teleological Problem

**Critique:** Functionalism explains things by their effects, which is circular logic.

**Example:**
"Why do the Trobrianders have the Kula? Because it functions to maintain trade and alliances."

But that's explaining the cause (Kula) by its effect (trade and alliances). How did the Kula start if its function didn't exist yet?

**Functionalist Response:** We're not explaining origins, just current maintenance. But critics argue that's not satisfactory.

### 2. Assumption of Integration

**Critique:** Not all societies are well-integrated. Some have contradictions, conflicts, dysfunction.

**Examples:**
- Class conflict in industrial societies
- Gender oppression (functional for men, dysfunctional for women)
- Colonialism disrupting integration

**Problem:** Functionalism assumes harmony when often there's struggle.

### 3. Conservative Bias

**Critique:** If everything functions to maintain the system, change seems problematic or deviant.

**Implication:**
- Colonial systems could be defended as "functional"
- Resistance seems dysfunctional
- Reform movements appear disruptive
- Status quo is naturalized

**Historical Context:** Functionalism emerged during British colonialism. It helped colonial administrators understand how to govern "native" systems—and often reinforced colonial control.

### 4. Ignores History

**Critique:** Present function doesn't explain origins. Historical context matters.

**Example:** English monarchy today has ceremonial function. But that doesn't explain how monarchy arose (conquest, power, tradition).

### 5. Ignores Power

**Critique:** Who benefits from an institution functioning? Functionalism treats everyone's needs equally.

**Example:**
- Patriarchy is "functional" for men, oppressive for women
- Class systems benefit elites
- Colonial systems functioned for colonizers

**Problem:** Functionalism often ignored whose interests institutions served.

### 6. Can't Explain Change

**Critique:** If everything functions to maintain equilibrium, how does change happen?

**Response:** Later functionalists (Gluckman, Turner) tried to address this, showing conflict can be functional and change adaptive. But classical functionalism struggled with change.

---

## Post-Functionalist Developments

### Edmund Leach: Critique from Within

**Leach (British anthropologist) argued:**

> **"Political Systems of Highland Burma" (1954):**
>
> - Kachin people don't have stable equilibrium
> - Oscillate between hierarchical (gumsa) and egalitarian (gumlao) systems
> - Contradictions built into social structure
> - Change is normal, not deviation
>
> **Implication:** Societies aren't always integrated or stable. Conflict and contradiction are normal.

### Victor Turner: Processual Analysis

**Turner studied rituals and symbols but moved beyond static functionalism:**

> **Social Drama:**
> - Societies have ongoing processes (breach → crisis → redress → reintegration)
> - Rituals transform, not just maintain
> - Liminality (betwixt and between) is productive
> - Change is inherent in social process

**Turner kept functionalism's insights but made it dynamic.**

## Functionalism's Lasting Contributions

### What Functionalism Got Right:

**1. Social Institutions Are Interconnected:**
Can't understand one aspect in isolation—holistic approach essential.

**2. "Irrational" Practices Often Have Rational Functions:**
Destroyed evolutionist condescension toward "primitive" practices by showing they serve real purposes.

**3. Empirical Observation Over Speculation:**
Shifted anthropology from armchair theorizing to systematic fieldwork.

**4. Synchronic Analysis Has Value:**
Even if we can't know origins, understanding current functioning is worthwhile.

**5. Established Intensive Fieldwork:**
Malinowski especially made long-term participant observation anthropology's signature method.

### What Later Anthropology Kept:

**Holism:**
Still central—anthropologists study cultural patterns, not isolated traits.

**Fieldwork Method:**
Malinowski's approach remains foundational.

**Attention to Social Integration:**
How societies cohere matters, even if not through simple functional equilibrium.

### What Was Abandoned:

**Simple Functional Explanations:**
"It exists because it functions" is no longer satisfactory.

**Equilibrium Assumption:**
Conflict, power, and change are central, not deviations.

**Ahistorical Approach:**
Historical context and change are essential.

**Conservative Politics:**
Anthropology increasingly embraces critical analysis of power and inequality.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Where Functionalist Thinking Persists:

**Medical Anthropology:**
How do healing systems function? What purposes do illness narratives serve?

**Organizational Anthropology:**
How do corporate cultures function? What role do rituals (meetings, team-building) serve?

**Systems Theory:**
Understanding complex interconnected systems (ecological, social, economic).

### Where It's Been Transcended:

**Political Economy:**
Asks "functional for whom?" and examines power.

**Practice Theory:**
People actively create and transform systems, not just maintain them.

**Historical Anthropology:**
Change and history are central.

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** If we can't explain origins, only current function, does that leave important questions unanswered?

**Question 2:** Can an institution be functional for society while being oppressive for some members? How do we account for whose interests matter?

**Question 3:** Is assuming social equilibrium ideologically conservative, or just an analytical tool?

**Question 4:** What practices in your society seem puzzling until you think about what functions they serve?

**Question 5:** If functionalism can't explain change well, does that make it fundamentally flawed, or just limited in scope?

**Remember:** Functionalism revolutionized anthropology by demanding empirical observation over speculation and showing "primitive" practices serve rational purposes. But its assumption of equilibrium, neglect of power, and conservative implications led to its decline. Contemporary anthropology keeps functionalism's holism and attention to interconnection while adding analysis of power, history, and change. Functionalism was essential but insufficient—a necessary stage in anthropology's development.
