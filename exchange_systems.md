# Exchange Systems: Reciprocity, Redistribution, and Markets

---

## Economics Beyond Markets

**Western assumption:** Economy = markets, money, profit, individual self-interest.

**Anthropology reveals:** Many economic systems work differently:
- No markets or money
- Exchange based on social relationships
- Production for use, not profit
- Embedded in kinship, politics, religion

**Karl Polanyi's Insight:** Modern capitalism is the exception, not the norm.

**Three fundamental forms of exchange:**
1. **Reciprocity** - Direct exchange between individuals
2. **Redistribution** - Collection and reallocation by central authority
3. **Market Exchange** - Supply and demand, price mechanism

**Most societies combine all three, but emphasize different forms.**

## Reciprocity: Exchange Between Equals

### Definition

**Reciprocity:** Exchange of goods and services between individuals or groups with expectation of return.

**Key Features:**
- Creates and maintains social relationships
- Timing and equivalence flexible
- Social obligation, not legal contract
- Failure to reciprocate = social sanction

**Marshall Sahlins's Types:** Three forms on a continuum.

### 1. Generalized Reciprocity

**Definition:** Giving without expectation of immediate or equivalent return.

**Characteristics:**
- Altruistic (seemingly)
- No accounting or calculation
- Indefinite timing
- Trust that return will come eventually
- Can be quite imbalanced

**Where Found:**
- Within families, close kin
- Between intimate friends
- Small, close-knit communities

**Examples:**

**Parent-Child:**
- Parents give food, care, shelter to children
- Children don't repay immediately
- Eventually may care for aging parents
- But not exact calculation

**Sharing Meat:**
- Hunter kills large animal
- Shares with entire group
- No expectation of exact return
- Trust that others will share when they succeed

**Hospitality:**
- Welcoming guests, feeding them
- No charge
- Expectation of reciprocal welcome someday

> **Example: !Kung Sharing**
>
> Kalahari foragers:
> - Successful hunter shares meat widely
> - Doesn't keep for self/family
> - Everyone eats
> - No tally of who gave what
> - Social pressure to share ("insulting the meat")
> - "I am not a big man, just a hunter"
>
> **Function:** 
> - Risk reduction (hunting unpredictable—insurance)
> - Social leveling (prevents inequality)
> - Maintains social bonds

**Modern Examples:**
- Family meals (parents don't charge children)
- Helping friends move (no payment)
- Borrowing sugar from neighbor
- Birthday gifts within family

**Distance:** Closest social distance = most generalized reciprocity.

### 2. Balanced Reciprocity

**Definition:** Exchange with expectation of equivalent return within reasonable time.

**Characteristics:**
- More calculated than generalized
- Equivalence matters
- Timing somewhat specified
- Direct exchange between parties
- If not reciprocated, relationship damaged

**Where Found:**
- Between friends, acquaintances
- Trade partners
- Across groups
- Broader social networks

**Examples:**

**Gift Exchange:**
- Birthday presents
- Holiday gifts
- Expect roughly equivalent gift in return
- Track (loosely) who gave what

**Barter:**
- Direct exchange of goods
- Negotiate equivalence
- No money but still balanced

**Hosting/Being Hosted:**
- You host dinner party
- Expect to be invited back
- Rough equivalence in hospitality

> **Example: Kula Ring (Trobriands)**
>
> Melanesian island exchange network:
> - Necklaces (soulava) travel clockwise
> - Armbands (mwali) travel counterclockwise
> - Partners exchange items
> - Not simultaneous but eventually balanced
> - Relationships maintained through exchange
> - Prestige from participation
>
> **Function:**
> - Creates alliances between islands
> - Peace through trade
> - Status competition
> - Malinowski's classic study

**Balanced ≠ Simultaneous:**
- May not exchange at same moment
- But expectation of return
- Tracking matters

**Modern Examples:**
- Exchanging Christmas cards
- Wedding gifts (registry indicates value)
- "I'll buy this round, you buy next"
- Potluck dinners

**Distance:** Intermediate social distance = balanced reciprocity.

### 3. Negative Reciprocity

**Definition:** Exchange where each party tries to maximize own gain, minimize loss.

**Characteristics:**
- Self-interested, strategic
- Bargaining, haggling
- Try to get more than you give
- Immediate exchange preferred
- Little trust

**Where Found:**
- With strangers, enemies
- Across hostile groups
- Anonymous transactions
- Maximum social distance

**Examples:**

**Hard Bargaining:**
- Market haggling
- Each side trying to get best deal
- Seller inflates price, buyer lowballs
- Meet somewhere in middle

**Theft:**
- Taking without giving
- Extreme negative reciprocity

**Cheating in Trade:**
- Dishonest scales
- Misrepresenting quality
- Giving bad goods for good

> **Example: "Silent Trade"**
>
> Historical accounts (debated accuracy):
> - Distant groups who don't trust each other
> - One group leaves goods
> - Other group takes, leaves different goods
> - No face-to-face contact
> - Each tries to get better deal
> - Extreme social distance

**Modern Examples:**
- Used car sales (stereotypically)
- Haggling in tourist markets
- Adversarial negotiations
- Pyramid schemes, scams

**Distance:** Maximum social distance = negative reciprocity.

### Sahlins's Continuum

```
Generalized ←----------→ Balanced ←----------→ Negative
(close kin)    (friends)    (acquaintances)    (strangers)
(altruistic)   (equivalent) (calculated)       (exploitative)
```

**Key Insight:** Type of reciprocity corresponds to social distance.

**Prediction:** Closer relationship → more generalized. Distant/hostile → more negative.

## Redistribution: Centralized Collection and Reallocation

### Definition

**Redistribution:** Goods flow to central authority, then redistributed back to population.

**Flow Pattern:**
```
Individuals → Central Authority → Back to Individuals
```

**Key Features:**
- Centralized collection
- Authority decides allocation
- Can redistribute to different people than contributed
- Creates and reinforces hierarchy

### How It Works

**Collection:**
- Tribute, taxes, offerings
- Corvée labor (labor tax)
- Obligatory gifts to chief/leader

**Reallocation:**
- Feasts, ceremonies
- Gifts to supporters
- Public works
- Storage for emergencies
- Support for specialists (priests, artisans)

**Authority Gains:**
- Power, prestige, followers
- Obligation from recipients
- Coordination capacity

### Examples Across Scales

**Chiefdoms:**

> **Example: Polynesian Chiefs**
>
> Traditional Hawaii, Tonga, Samoa:
> - Commoners give food, goods, labor to chief
> - Chief hosts massive feasts
> - Redistributes to followers
> - Maintains prestige through generosity
> - "Big Man" but with hereditary authority
>
> **Function:**
> - Smooths consumption (stores surplus)
> - Risk management (chief helps in crisis)
> - Legitimizes authority (through generosity)

**Ancient States:**

> **Example: Inca Empire**
>
> Andean state:
> - Corvée labor (mit'a) - work on state lands
> - Tribute in kind
> - Stored in massive warehouses (qollqa)
> - Redistributed to army, bureaucrats, public works
> - Also for famine relief
>
> **State provisioning:** Fed people working on temples, roads, etc.

**Modern Welfare States:**

> **Example: Social Democracy**
>
> Scandinavian countries:
> - Progressive taxation (wealth → state)
> - Welfare benefits (state → citizens)
> - Universal healthcare, education
> - Unemployment insurance
> - Pensions
>
> **Redistribution through state apparatus.**

### Potlatch: Competitive Redistribution

**Northwest Coast (Kwakwaka'wakw, Tlingit, Haida):**

**Potlatch = Ceremonial Feast:**
- Host gives away massive wealth
- Hundreds of blankets, copper plates, food
- Destroys valuables (burning)
- Guests must return more in their potlatch
- Escalating competition

**Functions:**

**Status Competition:**
- Prove wealth and generosity
- Shame rivals
- Establish hierarchy

**Redistribution:**
- Wealth flows to attendees
- Flattens inequality (temporarily)

**Validate Claims:**
- Marriages, inheritances, titles
- Witnesses legitimize

**Franz Boas's Study (1890s):**
- Described potlatch as gift-giving feast
- Irrational destruction of wealth? (Western view)
- No—creates prestige, maintains social order

**Canadian Ban (1884-1951):**
- Government outlawed potlatch
- Seen as wasteful, anti-capitalist
- Cultural suppression
- Continued secretly

**Contemporary Potlatches:**
- Legal again
- Modified form
- Cultural revival

### Problems with Redistribution

**Can Become Exploitative:**
- Authority takes more than returns
- Luxury consumption by elites
- Minimal redistribution to masses

**Legitimation:**
- Ideology that redistribution is generous
- Actually extraction

**Debate:** When does redistribution become taxation/exploitation?

## Market Exchange: Supply, Demand, Price

### Definition

**Market Exchange:** Goods and services exchanged through price mechanism.

**Characteristics:**
- Impersonal (don't need relationship with seller)
- Price determined by supply and demand
- Money medium
- Profit motive
- Competition

**Karl Polanyi:** Markets are "disembedded"—separated from social relationships.

### Historical Markets

**Not Modern Capitalism:**

**Marketplace ≠ Market Economy:**
- Ancient marketplaces existed
- But not dominant organizing principle
- Embedded in social/political structures

**Medieval Markets:**
- Local, periodic
- Social context important
- Regulations (just price, fair wage)
- Guilds controlled

### The Great Transformation (Polanyi, 1944)

**Industrial Revolution:**
- Markets became dominant
- "Fictitious commodities"—land, labor, money
- Self-regulating market (ideology)
- Disembedded from society

**Consequences:**
- Social dislocation
- Proletarianization (peasants → workers)
- Exploitation
- Resistance (unions, welfare state)

**Polanyi's Thesis:**
- Market society is historical anomaly
- Creates instability
- Society protects itself ("double movement")

### Modern Capitalism

**Characteristics:**
- Markets dominant
- Wage labor
- Private property
- Profit accumulation
- Competition
- Growth imperative

**But:**
- Still embedded socially
- Regulations, norms, trust
- Not purely impersonal
- Social networks matter (economic sociology)

**Anthropology of Capitalism:**
- How capitalism works culturally
- Not universal rationality
- Varies across contexts

## Combining Systems

### Most Societies Mix Forms

**Example: Contemporary US:**

**Generalized Reciprocity:**
- Within families
- Close friendships

**Balanced Reciprocity:**
- Gift exchanges
- Favors among friends

**Redistribution:**
- Taxes and welfare state
- Social Security
- Unemployment insurance

**Market:**
- Dominant for goods and services
- Wage labor
- Commodities

**All coexist, different spheres.**

### Spheres of Exchange

**Paul Bohannan (Tiv of Nigeria):**

**Three Spheres:**

**Subsistence:**
- Food, household items
- Exchanged within sphere
- Women's economy

**Prestige:**
- Cattle, slaves, metal rods
- Men's economy
- Bridgewealth

**Supreme:**
- Rights in people (marriage)
- Cannot buy with other goods

**Converting Between Spheres:**
- Possible but difficult
- Upward conversion prestigious
- Downward conversion shameful

**Shows:** Not all goods equivalent—different categories, different exchange rules.

### Moral Economy

**E.P. Thompson, James Scott:**

**Peasant economies organized by:**
- Subsistence ethic (survival first)
- Reciprocity norms
- Right to subsistence
- Resistance to market exploitation

**Moral Economy vs. Market:**
- Food = right, not commodity
- Hoarding during famine = immoral
- Just price (not market price)

**When Violated:**
- Riots, rebellions
- "Weapons of the weak"

**Shows:** Economy embedded in moral frameworks.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Gift Economies Online

**Open Source Software:**
- Programmers contribute code freely
- Generalized reciprocity
- Status through contribution
- Not market-driven

**Wikipedia:**
- Free knowledge production
- Volunteer labor
- Gift to humanity

**Social Media:**
- Content creation free
- Attention as currency?
- Or corporate extraction?

### Informal Economies

**Global South:**
- Majority work informally
- Reciprocity, redistribution crucial
- Markets exist but embedded
- Survival strategies

### Sharing Economy?

**Uber, Airbnb:**
- Marketed as "sharing"
- Actually market exchange
- Platform capitalism
- Commodification of previously non-market goods

**Critique:**
- Appropriates "sharing" rhetoric
- Exploits workers
- Not reciprocity—profit-driven

### Cryptocurrency and Alternative Economies

**Local Currencies:**
- Time banks (exchange hours)
- LETS (Local Exchange Trading Systems)
- Resist national currency

**Cryptocurrency:**
- Decentralized
- But still market-driven
- Not alternative to capitalism

## Formalist vs. Substantivist Debate (Preview)

**Two Approaches to Economic Anthropology:**

**Formalists:**
- Universal principles (supply, demand, scarcity, rationality)
- All economies analyzable with same tools
- Difference is degree, not kind

**Substantivists:**
- Economy = provisioning
- Embedded in society
- Non-market societies fundamentally different
- Cultural specificity matters

**Will explore in depth in separate file.**

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** In your life, can you identify all three types of reciprocity? What determines which you use?

**Question 2:** Is the welfare state redistribution (Polanyi) or something else?

**Question 3:** Does market exchange inevitably destroy reciprocity-based relationships?

**Question 4:** Are online "gift economies" (Wikipedia, open source) really gifts, or something new?

**Question 5:** Can modern societies function without markets, or is capitalism now inescapable?

**Remember:** Exchange isn't just economics—it's fundamentally social. Reciprocity creates and maintains relationships; type of reciprocity reflects social distance. Redistribution centralizes and reallocates, creating hierarchy. Markets are impersonal, price-driven—historically unusual as dominant form. Most societies combine all three but emphasize differently. Modern capitalism privileges markets, but reciprocity and redistribution persist. Understanding exchange systems reveals how different societies organize production, distribution, consumption—embedded in kinship, politics, religion, morality. Economy is cultural, not natural.
