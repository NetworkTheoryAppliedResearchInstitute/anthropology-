# Middle East: Tribal Societies and Pastoralism

---

## Middle East and Mediterranean: Overview

### Region

**Geographic Scope:**
- North Africa (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco)
- Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait)
- Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Palestine/Israel, Jordan)
- Mesopotamia (Iraq)
- Persia/Iran
- Turkey
- Sometimes: Afghanistan, Pakistan (borderlands)

**Diversity:**
- Languages: Arabic (dominant), Persian/Farsi, Turkish, Kurdish, Hebrew, Berber, many others
- Religions: Islam (majority, Sunni and Shia), Christianity (minorities), Judaism, Druze, Yazidi, Zoroastrian, others
- Ethnicity: Arab, Persian, Turkish, Kurdish, Berber, many others
- NOT monolithic (enormous internal diversity)

**Anthropological Challenges:**
- Orientalism (Edward Said critique, see below)
- Political access (conflicts, authoritarian regimes)
- Security concerns (fieldwork difficulties)
- Western bias (problematic representations)

---

## Segmentary Lineage Systems

### Theoretical Importance

**Definition:**
- Patrilineal descent groups (nested segments)
- Minimal lineage → minor → major → maximal → tribe
- No permanent centralized authority
- Relative opposition (context-dependent alliances)

**E.E. Evans-Pritchard:**
- *The Nuer* (1940) - see Phase 2, Africa
- Developed theory (Sudan, but influential for Middle East)

**Middle East Application:**
- Bedouin tribes (Arabian Peninsula, North Africa)
- Cyrenaica (Libya, Bedouin)
- Kurdish tribes (mountains)

---

## Bedouin Pastoralism

### Desert Nomads

**Bedouin:**
- Arabic: "badawī" (desert dweller)
- Pastoral nomads (camels, sheep, goats)
- Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, Levant, Sinai

**Subsistence:**
- Herding (camels primary, prestigious; sheep/goats for food/milk)
- Trade (transport goods, caravans historically)
- Raiding (*ghazw*, traditional, pre-state)
- Some agriculture (oases, settled kin)

**Social Organization:**
- Patrilineal descent (tribes, *qabila*)
- Segmentary (nested lineages)
- Genealogies (oral, extensive, political charters)
- Endogamy (parallel cousin marriage, FBD preferred)

**Mobility:**
- Seasonal movements (pasture, water)
- Tents (portable, black goat hair, *bayt sha'r*)
- Territoriality (tribal *dirah*, range)

---

## Emrys Peters and Cyrenaica Bedouin

### Classic Ethnography

**Emrys Peters:**
- Cyrenaica, Libya (1940s-1950s)
- *"The Proliferation of Segments in the Lineage of the Bedouin of Cyrenaica"* (1960)

**Insights:**
- Segmentary lineage (practical application)
- Fission (lineages split, proliferate)
- Territorial sections (matched to genealogical structure)
- Balance (principle of relative opposition)

**Critiques:**
- Model too neat (reality messier)
- Ignored women, non-kin ties
- Static (ignored change, history)
- Colonial influence (Bedouin already changed by Italians)

---

## Honor and Shame

### Mediterranean Complex

**Concepts:**
- **Honor** (*sharaf*, *'ird*, *namus*): Social worth, reputation, integrity
- **Shame** (*'ayb*): Loss of honor, disgrace

**Gender:**
- Male honor linked to female chastity (women's sexual purity)
- Women = repositories of family honor
- Control of women (strict, surveillance, seclusion)
- Virginity = essential (marriage, family reputation)

**Violence:**
- Honor killings (women suspected/accused of sexual impropriety)
  - Killed by male relatives (father, brother)
  - Restore family honor
  - Illegal but practiced (some countries, lighter sentences)
- Blood feud (*tha'r*, revenge for honor violations)

**Debates:**

**Julian Pitt-Rivers:**
- Andalusian village (Spain, 1950s)
- *The People of the Sierra* (1954)
- Honor-shame complex (Mediterranean-wide pattern)

**Lila Abu-Lughod:**
- *Veiled Sentiments* (1986)
- Awlad 'Ali Bedouin (Egypt)
- Challenged honor-shame model (oversimplified)
- Women's agency (poetry, subversion, strategies)
- Honor = complex, multivalent (not just male control)

**Critiques:**
- Essentialist (homogenizes diverse Mediterranean/Middle East)
- Orientalist (exoticizes, implies backwardness)
- Ignores change (modernization, urbanization)
- Overemphasizes (honor exists but not all-determining)

---

## Blood Feud and Conflict Resolution

### Revenge and Mediation

**Blood Feud (*tha'r*):**
- Killing demands revenge (honor obligation)
- Feud cycles (killing → counter-killing)
- Collective responsibility (lineage, not just individual)
- Can last generations

**Mediation:**
- Elders, respected mediators (*wasta*, connections)
- Compensation (*diya*, blood money)
- Reconciliation (formal, rituals, feasting)
- State weak (tribal law alongside/instead of state law)

**Yemen:**
- Tribal law (*'urf*) strong
- Feud common (pre-unification, ongoing)

**Jacob Black-Michaud:**
- *Cohesive Force* (1975)
- Feud as social structure (creates boundaries, alliances)

---

## Parallel Cousin Marriage

### FBD Preference

**Pattern:**
- Marriage to father's brother's daughter (FBD, parallel cousin)
- Preferred (ideal, not always practiced)
- Unique (globally rare, Middle East/North Africa common)

**Explanations:**

**Property retention:**
- Keep wealth within lineage (especially land)

**Alliance:**
- Strengthen lineage cohesion

**Pierre Bourdieu:**
- Algeria (Kabyle Berber)
- *Outline of a Theory of Practice* (1972, French; 1977, English)
- FBD marriage = strategy (practical logic, not rule)
- Manipulated (political, economic advantages)

**Critiques:**
- Preference ≠ practice (actual rates variable)
- Romanticized (Orientalist assumptions about closed societies)

---

## Gender and Women's Lives

### Complexity

**Seclusion and Veiling:**
- *Purdah* (seclusion, South Asia term but relevant)
- Veiling (variable: headscarf, *hijab*; face veil, *niqab*; full body, *burqa*)
- Meanings: Modesty, piety, respectability, identity
- NOT universal (class, region, personal choice)
- Debates: Oppression vs. agency

**Lila Abu-Lughod:**
- *Do Muslim Women Need Saving?* (2013)
  - Critique of Western "rescue" narratives
  - Muslim women's agency (diverse, strategic)
- *Veiled Sentiments* (1986) - see above
  - Bedouin women (poetry, emotion, resistance)

**Saba Mahmood:**
- *Politics of Piety* (2005)
  - Egyptian mosque movement (women)
  - Piety = form of agency (not just submission)
  - Challenging Western feminist assumptions

**Lila Abu-Lughod (again):**
- *Writing Women's Worlds* (1993)
  - Bedouin women (everyday lives, stories)
  - Multiple voices (not monolithic experience)

---

## Islam and Anthropology

### Approaching Religion

**Challenges:**
- Islam = diverse (NOT monolithic)
- Sunni/Shia split (theological, political)
- Regional variations (Arab/Persian/Turkish/South Asian, etc.)
- Local practices (syncretism, Sufism)

**Early Anthropology:**
- Orientalist (exoticizing, essentializing)
- "Islamic civilization" (homogenized)

**Contemporary:**
- Islam as lived experience (diverse interpretations)
- Agency (Muslims as active interpreters, not passive followers)
- Politics (Islam entangled with power, nationalism)

**Talal Asad:**
- *Genealogies of Religion* (1993)
  - Anthropology of Islam (critique of assumptions)
  - Islam = discursive tradition (ongoing interpretation)
  - Power (who defines orthodoxy?)
- *Formations of the Secular* (2003)
  - Secularism (modern, not universal)
  - Religion/secular divide (Western construct)

---

## Sufism

### Mystical Islam

**Definition:**
- Islamic mysticism
- Emphasis: Direct experience of God, inner spirituality
- Practices: Dhikr (remembrance chanting), meditation, music/dance (some orders)

**Orders (*tariqas*):**
- Organized groups (teachers, *shaykhs*; disciples, *murids*)
- Mevlevi (Turkey, "whirling dervishes")
- Qadiriyya (widespread)
- Naqshbandi (Central Asia, Middle East)
- Many others

**Shrines (*ziyara*):**
- Saints' tombs (pilgrimage sites)
- Blessings (*baraka*, spiritual power)
- Popular Islam (contested by strict Sunni, Salafi)

**Anthropological Work:**
- Michael Gilsenan: Egypt, Lebanon (Sufi orders)
- Vincent Crapanzano: Morocco (Hamadsha brotherhood)

---

## Urban Traditions

### Cities and Bazaars

**Ancient Cities:**

- Christian quarter, Jewish quarter, Muslim majority
- Internal governance (neighborhood leaders)

**Clifford Geertz:**
- Morocco (Sefrou, 1960s-1970s)
- Bazaar economy (*suq*)
- Information search (bargaining, uncertainty, trust)

**Suad Joseph:**
- Lebanon (Beirut)
- *Intimate Selving in Arab Families* (1999)
  - Family, kinship, selfhood
  - Connectivity (relationality, not Western individualism)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Does segmentary lineage theory accurately describe Middle Eastern societies or impose a model?

**Question 2:** Is honor-shame a useful framework or Orientalist oversimplification?

**Question 3:** How do we study Islam anthropologically without essentializing?

**Question 4:** What does it mean to be stateless (Kurds, Palestinians)?

**Question 5:** Can parallel cousin marriage be explained functionally or is it just tradition?
