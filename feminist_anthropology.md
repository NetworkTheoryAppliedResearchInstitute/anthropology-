# Feminist Anthropology: Gender, Power, and the Revolution Within (1970s-1990s)

---

## The Personal is Theoretical

In the 1970s, women anthropologists looked at their discipline and asked uncomfortable questions:

- Why are most ethnographies about men's activities?
- Why do "mankind," "man the hunter," stand for all humanity?
- Why is women's work invisible in ethnographic accounts?
- Why do male anthropologists miss women's perspectives?
- Why does anthropology naturalize women's subordination?

**Feminist anthropology** emerged to fundamentally transform how the discipline understood gender, power, and culture. This wasn't just adding women—it was reconceptualizing anthropology itself.

## The Problem: Male Bias in Anthropology

### What Was Wrong With Previous Anthropology?

**1. Androcentric (Male-Centered) Ethnography:**

> **Classic Example: "Man the Hunter" (1966)**
>
> Influential conference and volume argued:
> - Hunting (men's activity) drove human evolution
> - Hunting required intelligence, cooperation, tool use
> - Men's activities created civilization
>
> **What about women?** 
> - Gathering (women's activity) = boring, simple
> - Childcare = passive, not productive
> - Women = biological reproducers, not cultural creators

**The Problem:** Assumed men's activities are important, women's activities are trivial.

**2. Studying Men, Generalizing to All:**

Most ethnographies primarily described:
- Men's political organization
- Men's religious rituals
- Men's economic activities
- Men's perspectives

**Women appeared as:**
- Property exchanged between men (kinship analysis)
- Mothers of sons
- Marginal to public life

**3. Missing Women's Perspectives:**

**Malinowski on Trobriands:** Focused on men's Kula exchange, missed women's exchange system (Annette Weiner later discovered).

**Evans-Pritchard on Nuer:** Described patrilineal kinship from men's viewpoint, less attention to women's experiences.

**The Pattern:** Male anthropologists (mostly) talked to male informants about male activities.

**4. Naturalizing Gender Inequality:**

**Functionalist explanation:** 
- Gender roles serve functions
- Division of labor is adaptive
- Women's subordination is universal and natural

**This naturalized patriarchy** rather than questioning it.

## Feminist Anthropology's Emergence

### Foundational Works (1970s)

**"Woman, Culture, and Society" (1974)**
Edited by Michelle Rosaldo and Louise Lamphere

**"Toward an Anthropology of Women" (1975)**
Edited by Rayna Rapp Reiter

**These collections asked:**
- Is women's subordination universal?
- What causes gender inequality?
- How do different cultures construct gender?
- How can anthropology be transformed?

### Key Early Arguments

**Sherry Ortner: "Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?" (1974)**

**The Question:** Why are women symbolically associated with nature, men with culture?

**The Argument:**

**Universal associations:**
- Women = nature, body, reproduction, domestic
- Men = culture, mind, production, public
- Culture > Nature (in hierarchical terms)
- Therefore Men > Women

**Why?**

**Women's reproductive capacity:**
- Pregnancy, childbirth, nursing tie women to body/nature
- Men's lack of reproductive role allows cultural work
- Women's domestic work (childcare) = close to nature
- Men's public work = creating culture

**Ortner's Point:** Not that women ARE closer to nature, but that they're symbolically constructed that way—and this construction justifies subordination.

**Critiques of Ortner:**
- Assumes universality (nature/culture distinction itself is Western)
- Essentializes women (reproduction)
- Overgeneralizes

**But:** Opened crucial conversation about symbolic construction of gender.

**Michelle Rosaldo: "Woman, Culture, and Society" (1974)**

**The Argument:**

**Universal (or near-universal) domestic/public split:**
- **Domestic sphere:** Home, childrearing, family (women's domain)
- **Public sphere:** Politics, economics, ritual (men's domain)
- Public sphere has more prestige and power
- Women confined to domestic sphere → subordination

**Why universal?**
Women's reproductive role ties them to domestic sphere, men freed for public activities.

**Rosaldo Later Recanted** (1980), saying:
- Domestic/public split is Western construct
- Doesn't apply universally
- Essentialized women through biology

**The Revision Shows:** Feminist anthropology self-critical, evolving.

## Major Themes in Feminist Anthropology

### 1. Challenging "Man the Hunter"

**"Woman the Gatherer" Response:**

**Sally Linton (Slocum): "Woman the Gatherer" (1975)**

**Counter-Argument:**
- Gathering (women's activity) provided most calories
- Gathering required knowledge, tools, cooperation, intelligence
- Food sharing initiated from gathered foods
- Women's inventions (containers, digging sticks, slings for babies) were crucial
- Women drove human evolution as much as men

**Adrienne Zihlman:** Emphasized female evolutionary agency.

**The Point:** Not that women are more important but that BOTH genders shaped human evolution. The androcentric story was ideological, not scientific.

### 2. Documenting Women's Economic Contributions

**Showing women's work is:**
- Productive, not just reproductive
- Economically crucial
- Often invisible to male observers
- Undervalued despite importance

> **Example: Annette Weiner on Trobriands**
>
> Returned to Trobriands (1970s) and found what Malinowski missed:
>
> **Women's Wealth System:**
> - Women make banana leaf bundles and skirts
> - Exchange them at mortuary ceremonies
> - Control large-scale wealth distributions
> - Women's exchanges parallel men's Kula
> - Women have economic power and prestige
>
> **Why Did Malinowski Miss This?**
> - Focused on men's activities
> - Gender bias
> - Women didn't explain their systems to male stranger

### 3. Kinship From Women's Perspectives

**Rethinking kinship:**

**Previous approach:** Men exchange women (Lévi-Strauss), women as objects.

**Feminist approach:** 
- Women as agents, not objects
- Women's kinship strategies
- Women's perspectives on marriage
- Matrilineal systems where women have power
- Women's networks and alliances

**Rayna Rapp, Jane Collier, Sylvia Yanagisako:** Critiqued kinship studies for naturalizing gender and biology.

### 4. Is Patriarchy Universal?

**The Debate:**

**Universal Male Dominance View:**
Some argued women are subordinate in all societies (Ortner, Rosaldo's early work).

**Challenge:**
Is this ethnocentric? Are there egalitarian societies?

**Eleanor Leacock:** Studied indigenous North American societies, argued:
- Pre-colonial societies more egalitarian
- Colonialism imposed European gender hierarchy
- "Universal" subordination is colonial product

**Consensus:** 
- Complete equality rare
- Degrees of inequality vary enormously
- Context matters more than universals

### 5. Gender vs. Sex

**Crucial Distinction:**

**Sex:** Biological (chromosomes, genitals, hormones) - though itself more complex than simple binary

**Gender:** Cultural construction (roles, behaviors, identities, meanings) - varies cross-culturally

**Feminist anthropology showed:**
- What counts as "masculine" or "feminine" varies culturally
- Gender roles aren't biologically determined
- Third genders and alternative gender systems exist
- Gender is performed, not natural essence

> **Examples of Gender Diversity:**
>
> **Native American Two-Spirit people:** Culturally recognized third/fourth genders
>
> **Samoan fa'afafine:** People assigned male at birth living as women, distinct gender category
>
> **Indian hijra:** Third gender, often intersex or transgender
>
> **Albanian burrnesha:** Biological females taking male social roles
>
> **Thai kathoey, Brazilian travestí, Polynesian mahu, Zapotec muxe:** All culturally specific gender categories beyond male/female binary

**The Point:** If gender is culturally constructed, it can be different—not biologically fixed.

### 6. Intersectionality

**Kimberlé Crenshaw coined "intersectionality" (1989), but anthropologists were already thinking this way:**

**Can't understand gender without also analyzing:**
- Race/ethnicity
- Class
- Sexuality
- Nation
- Age
- Religion
- Ability

**Example:**
- White upper-class woman's experience ≠ Black working-class woman's experience
- Can't generalize "women" as universal category
- Must attend to specific intersecting positions

**Anthropologists like:**
- Angela Davis: Race, gender, class
- Audre Lorde: Multiple identities
- Chandra Mohanty: Postcolonial feminism

### 7. Critiquing Development

**"Women in Development" vs. "Gender and Development":**

**Early approach (WID):**
- Add women to development projects
- Assume Western gender roles are goal

**Feminist critique (GAD):**
- Development often harms women
- Imposing Western gender ideology
- Destroying women's traditional economic roles
- Creating new inequalities

**Esther Boserup:** Showed how development and colonialism reduced women's economic status.

## Theoretical Contributions

### 1. Standpoint Theory

**Idea:** Knowledge is situated—what you see depends on where you stand.

**Women's standpoint:**
- Offers perspectives men miss
- Reveals aspects of culture invisible from male position
- Not "better" but essential and different

**For Anthropology:**
- Need women ethnographers
- Need to talk to women informants
- Need women's perspectives in analysis

### 2. The Social Construction of the Body

**Against biological determinism:**

**Bodies themselves are culturally interpreted:**
- Menstruation meanings vary (pollution vs. power)
- Childbirth experiences shaped culturally
- Body ideals differ cross-culturally
- Even biological "facts" are interpreted through cultural lenses

**Emily Martin:** Showed how Western medicine uses industrial metaphors for women's reproduction (factory, production).

### 3. Reproduction as Production

**Against reproduction vs. production binary:**

**Reproduction is:**
- Labor (childbirth, childcare, nursing)
- Productive work, not just biological
- Economically valuable
- Socially organized
- Politically contested

**Counts as work,** not just nature.

### 4. Challenging Public/Private Dichotomy

**Western ideology:**
- Public = politics, economy, important
- Private = home, family, trivial

**Feminist anthropologists showed:**
- Dichotomy itself is cultural
- Much important activity happens in "private"
- Women's domestic work supports public sphere
- False separation hides women's contributions

## Ethnographic Contributions

### Lila Abu-Lughod: Muslim Women's Agency

**Against stereotypes of Muslim women as oppressed victims:**

> **Bedouin Women (Egypt):**
>
> Abu-Lughod showed:
> - Women use poetry to express emotions and resist
- Women have strategies and agency within patriarchal system
> - Not just victims but active agents
> - Respect for women's perspectives and choices
>
> **Against:** Western feminism imposing its values on other cultures.

**"Do Muslim Women Really Need Saving?" (2002):** Critiqued Western missionary feminism.

### Marilyn Strathern: Melanesian Gender

**"The Gender of the Gift" (1988):**

**Argued:**
- Melanesian gender concepts differ fundamentally from Western
- Not reducible to Western categories
- Must understand on Melanesian terms
- Anthropology's gender concepts themselves culturally specific

**Challenged:** Universal feminist theories based on Western assumptions.

### Emily Martin: Medical Anthropology and Gender

**"The Woman in the Body" (1987):**

**Analyzed:**
- How Western medicine represents women's reproduction
- Metaphors: Production, efficiency, breakdown
- Women's own experiences vs. medical model
- Body as contested site

## Critiques and Debates

### 1. Essentialism

**Critique:** Does feminist anthropology sometimes essentialize women?

**The Risk:**
- Treating "women" as universal category
- Assuming shared experiences across cultures
- Biology determines gender

**Response:** 
- Later feminist anthropology emphasized diversity among women
- Intersectionality
- Anti-essentialist feminism

### 2. Western Feminism Imposed?

**Critique:** Is feminist anthropology imposing Western values?

**The Tension:**
- Critique patriarchy everywhere (universal feminism)
- Respect cultural differences (cultural relativism)

**How can you critique gender inequality without cultural imperialism?**

**Responses:**
- Listen to local women's own critiques
- Support indigenous feminisms
- Avoid missionary feminism
- Recognize multiple feminisms

### 3. What About Men?

**Critique:** Feminist anthropology only studies women.

**Response:**
- Studying masculinity important too
- Gender affects everyone
- Men have gender, not just women
- Masculinity studies emerged

### 4. Beyond Binary?

**Critique:** Even feminist anthropology sometimes reinforces male/female binary.

**Response:**
- Transgender and queer anthropology
- Non-binary genders
- Gender fluidity
- Gender as spectrum, not binary

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is women's subordination universal, or is this a Western/colonial imposition?

**Question 2:** Can feminist anthropology critique gender inequality while respecting cultural relativism?

**Question 3:** Why did it take until the 1970s for anthropology to take gender seriously?

**Question 4:** Does focusing on gender risk essentializing women or reinforcing binary?

**Question 5:** How have gender roles in your society changed over time? What does this reveal about the cultural construction of gender?

**Remember:** Feminist anthropology didn't just add women to anthropological analysis—it fundamentally transformed how the discipline thinks about gender, power, knowledge, and culture. Showing gender is culturally constructed (not biologically fixed) was revolutionary politically and intellectually. Contemporary anthropology routinely analyzes gender as central to culture, power, and meaning. But feminist anthropology also reminds us: must attend to diversity among women, avoid Western feminist imperialism, and combine gender analysis with attention to race, class, sexuality, and other intersecting identities. Gender is always intersectional and always political.
