# Education and Learning: Schooling and Knowledge Transmission

---

## Formal vs. Informal Learning

### Two Modes

**Informal Learning:**
- Everyday life
- Observation, participation
- No specialized teachers
- Most human history
- Still dominant many societies

**Formal Education:**
- Schools, teachers
- Specialized knowledge
- Age-graded, credentialed
- Modern phenomenon (mass)
- Spread with colonialism, nation-states

**Not Better/Worse:**
- Different purposes
- Both effective

---

## Informal Learning and Apprenticeship

### Learning by Doing

**Jean Lave & Etienne Wenger:**
- "Situated Learning"
- Learning = participation
- Communities of practice
- Legitimate peripheral participation
- Move from novice → expert

**Examples:**

> **Vai Tailors (Liberia)**
>
> - Apprenticeship
> - Observe, practice
> - Gradually more complex
> - No explicit teaching
> - Embedded in work

> **Mayan Midwives (Guatemala)**
>
> - Learn through observation
> - Accompany experienced midwife
> - Years of participation
> - Traditional knowledge

**Barbara Rogoff:**
- "Apprenticeship in Thinking"
- Guided participation
- Cultural learning
- Cognitive development

> **Africa (Colonial)**
>
> - Mission schools
> - European languages

**Remember:** Formal vs. informal learning—both effective, different purposes. Informal learning through apprenticeship (Lave & Wenger situated learning, legitimate peripheral participation). Literacy is social practice not neutral skill (Street, Scribner & Cole). Colonial education imposed globally, erased indigenous knowledge, boarding schools cultural genocide. Schools have hidden curriculum (Durkheim, Bourdieu reproduction). Educational inequality by class (Willis, Lareau), race (Fordham, Carter), gender. Testing reproduces inequality. Alternative education (indigenous schools, democratic schools). Universities neoliberalized. Study abroad/educational migration. Digital learning. Knowledge is power (Foucault), whose knowledge counts (Smith decolonizing). Homeschooling. Learning culturally shaped (Vygotsky, Cole). Understanding education anthropology reveals how societies transmit knowledge, reproduce inequality, shape minds—education is always cultural, political, contested.
