# Settler Colonialism and Genocide in the Americas

---

## Contact and Catastrophe

### Demographic Collapse

**Pre-Contact Population:**
- 50-100+ million (Americas total, estimates vary)

**Post-Contact (1600):**
- ~10% survived (some estimates)
- **90% population loss** (worst demographic catastrophe in human history)

**Causes:**

**1. Disease (Primary):**
- Indigenous peoples: No immunity (Old World diseases)
- **Virgin soil epidemics** (Alfred Crosby term)
  - Entire populations (no prior exposure)
- Diseases: Smallpox, measles, typhus, influenza, plague, others
- Waves (repeated epidemics)

**Mechanisms:**
- European contact (direct)
- Trade networks (spread ahead of Europeans)
- Some areas: Depopulated before Europeans arrived

**Debate:**
- Intentional? (biowarfare)
- Mostly: Unintentional (but Europeans recognized advantage)
- Some intentional cases (blankets, smallpox, Fort Pitt 1763)

**2. Violence:**
- Conquest, warfare
- Enslavement
- Massacres

**3. Exploitation:**
- Forced labor (mines, plantations)
- Starvation (resource extraction)
- Spanish *encomienda* system (labor tribute)

**4. Social Disruption:**
- Families torn apart
- Loss of knowledge (elders die)
- Demoralization

## Settler Colonialism

### Distinct from Other Colonialisms

**Patrick Wolfe:**
- "Settler colonialism is a structure, not an event"
- Ongoing (not past)

**Characteristics:**

**1. Elimination of Indigenous Peoples:**
- "Logic of elimination" (Wolfe)
- Goal: Remove natives (physically, culturally)
- Replace with settlers

**Contrast:**
- Exploitation colonialism (Africa, Asia): Extract labor, resources
- Settlers: Eliminate, replace

**2. Land:**
- Central (acquire indigenous land)
- Settlers want to stay (not return to metropole)

**3. Ongoing:**
- Not finished (continues)
- Contemporary indigenous issues (rooted in settler colonialism)

---

## Doctrines of Dispossession

### Legal Frameworks

**Doctrine of Discovery:**
- European legal principle (15th-16th C)
- Papal bulls (Catholic Church)
- "Discovered" land = Christian European claim
- Ignored indigenous sovereignty

**Terra Nullius:**
- "Nobody's land"
- Claim: Land empty or not "properly" used
- Ignored indigenous occupation, use

**Used:**
- Australia (British, until 1992 *Mada* decision)
- Americas (various)

**Conquest:**
- Military defeat = legitimate ownership
- Imposed treaties (coerced, fraudulent often)

---

## United States: Removal and Reservations

### Westward Expansion

**19th Century:**
- US expands west (manifest destiny ideology)
- Indigenous peoples: Obstacle

**Indian Removal Act (1830):**
- President Andrew Jackson
- Forced relocation (Southeast tribes to Oklahoma, "Indian Territory")

**Trail of Tears (1838-1839):**
- Cherokee removal (Georgia → Oklahoma)
- Forced march (winter)
- ~4,000 died (of ~15,000)
- Other tribes: Similar forced removals (Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole)

**Reservations:**
- Confine indigenous peoples (specific areas)
- Reduced land base (dramatically)
- Poorest land (usually)
- Examples: Pine Ridge (Lakota), Navajo Nation (largest)

**Broken Treaties:**
- US signed ~400 treaties (indigenous nations)
- Violated most (systematically)

**Indian Wars:**
- Resistance (armed conflict)
- Examples:
  - Red Cloud's War (1866-1868, Lakota, temporary victory)
  - Little Bighorn (1876, Lakota/Cheyenne victory, Custer killed)
  - Wounded Knee Massacre (1890, US troops kill ~300 Lakota, mostly women/children)

## Cultural Genocide

### Assimilation Policies

**Goal:**
- "Kill the Indian, save the man" (Richard Pratt, 1892, Carlisle Indian School founder)
- Eliminate culture, assimilate into settler society

**Methods:**

**1. Boarding Schools:**
- Remove children from families
- English only (native languages forbidden, punished)
- Christian conversion
- Western clothing, haircuts
- Manual labor (boys), domestic work (girls)

**US/Canada:**
- Late 19th - mid/late 20th C (some until 1970s-1990s)
- Hundreds of schools

**Experiences:**
- Abuse (physical, sexual, emotional)
- Neglect, disease
- Deaths (thousands, unmarked graves)
- Trauma (intergenerational)
- Loss of language, culture
- Some resistance (running away, secret language use)

**Canada (Residential Schools):**
- ~150,000 children (150 years)
- Last school closed (1996)
- Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2008-2015)
  - Documented abuses
  - "Cultural genocide" (official term used)
  - 94 Calls to Action (recommendations)

**US:**
- Similar system
- Less formal reckoning (some efforts, ongoing)

**2. Allotment:**
- Dawes Act (1887, US)
- Break up reservations (communal land → individual plots)
- "Surplus" land sold (to settlers)
- Result: Indigenous land loss (90 million → 48 million acres by 1934)

**3. Banning Cultural Practices:**
- Sun Dance, potlatch, others (illegal, US/Canada)
- Religious freedom denied (until 1978, US Indian Religious Freedom Act)

## Latin America

### Distinct Patterns

**Spanish Colonialism:**
- Exploitation (labor, not elimination entirely)
- *Encomienda*, *hacienda* systems
- Mestizaje (racial mixing, encouraged)
- Demographic collapse (disease primarily)

**Contemporary:**
- Indigenous identities (stronger in some areas)
- Movements (rights, autonomy)

**Brazil:**
- Amazonian groups (contact, 20th C some)
- FUNAI (government agency, indigenous affairs)
- Conflicts (land, development)

**Guatemala:**
- Civil war (1960-1996)
- Indigenous Maya (majority population)
- Genocide (1980s, Ríos Montt regime)
  - ~200,000 killed (mostly Maya)
  - Scorched earth (villages destroyed)

---

## Resistance and Resilience

### Indigenous Agency

**Not Passive Victims:**
- Resistance (armed, cultural, political)
- Adaptation (strategic)
- Survival (despite everything)

**Examples:**

**Armed Resistance:**
- Inca rebellion (Túpac Amaru II, 1780-1781, Peru)
- Pontiac's War (1763-1766, Great Lakes)
- Tecumseh's confederacy (1811, pan-indigenous alliance)
- Apache Wars (Geronimo, 1850s-1886)
- Zapatista uprising (1994, Mexico, Chiapas, Maya)

**Cultural Persistence:**
- Languages maintained (despite suppression)
- Ceremonies (hidden, continued)
- Oral traditions (passed down)
- Adaptations (syncretism)

**Legal/Political:**
- Treaties (asserted rights)
- Courts (litigation)
- Activism (20th-21st C, see next file)

---

## Genocide Debates

### Defining Genocide

**UN Convention (1948):**
- Acts committed with intent to destroy (in whole or part) a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group
- Includes: Killing, causing serious harm, inflicting conditions to destroy, preventing births, transferring children

**Americas:**
- Fits definition? (debated)

**Arguments FOR:**
- Intentional destruction (policies aimed at elimination)
- Cultural genocide (boarding schools, language suppression)
- Physical destruction (massacres, forced removals, conditions)

**Arguments AGAINST (or Qualification):**
- Disease: Unintentional (mostly)
- Varied (not monolithic, time/place)
- "Genocide" = specific intent (legal definition, hard to prove for all)

**Scholars:**
- Many use "genocide" (David Stannard, Dee Brown)
- UN Rapporteur (2012): Cultural genocide at minimum
- Historiography: Increasingly accepted term

**Indigenous Perspective:**
- Many communities: Genocide (experienced as such)
- Not academic debate (lived reality)

## Specific Case: California

### "Slow" Genocide

**Pre-Contact:**
- ~300,000+ indigenous people (California)

**1900:**
- ~15,000 (95% loss)

**Methods:**
- Disease (major)
- Violence:
  - Massacres (settlers, militias)
  - Scalp bounties (state paid for indigenous scalps, 1850s)
  - Slavery (legalized, 1850, "apprenticeship")
  - Vigilante killings
- Starvation (land taken, food sources destroyed)

**Recent Reckoning:**
- Governor Gavin Newsom (2019): Apology, "genocide"

---

## Environmental Destruction

### Land and Resources

**Colonial/Settler Impacts:**
- Deforestation (logging)
- Species extinction (bison near-extinction, deliberate to starve Plains peoples)
- Mining (pollution, sacred sites destroyed)
- Dams (salmon runs destroyed, Northwest)

**Contemporary:**
- Continued resource extraction (indigenous lands)
- Pipelines, mining (opposed by indigenous communities)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Was the demographic collapse primarily disease or genocide?

**Question 2:** Can cultural destruction (boarding schools) be genocide?

**Question 3:** Is "settler colonialism" still ongoing in the Americas?

**Question 4:** How do we memorialize atrocities while avoiding "victim" narratives?

**Question 5:** What does justice look like for historical genocide?
