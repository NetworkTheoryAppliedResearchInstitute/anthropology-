# Defining Religion: Approaches and Debates

---

## What Is Religion?

**Seemingly simple question, profoundly difficult answer.**

**Why Hard to Define?**
- Enormous diversity (Buddhism, Islam, Navajo, Vodou, etc.)
- Western bias (Christianity as model)
- What counts as "religion"?
- Universal category or Western invention?

**Three Main Approaches:**
1. **Substantive** (what religion IS)
2. **Functional** (what religion DOES)
3. **Symbolic/Interpretive** (what religion MEANS)

**Plus critical view:** "Religion" itself is problematic category.

## Substantive Definitions: Belief in Supernatural

### Edward Tylor: "Animism" (1871)

**"Minimum Definition":**
- Religion = belief in spiritual beings
- Animism = attribution of soul/spirit
- Evolved from simple (animism) to complex (monotheism)

**Animism:**
- Primitive humans see spirits everywhere
- Souls, ghosts, nature spirits
- Foundation of all religion

**Evolutionist:**
- Religion progresses: animism → polytheism → monotheism
- "Primitive" to "civilized"
- Science will eventually replace religion

**Problems:**
- Ethnocentric (Christianity as pinnacle)
- Unilineal evolution (discredited)
- Ignores Buddhism (no gods)
- Many "religions" lack belief in spirits

**But Influential:** First systematic anthropological theory of religion.

### Clifford Geertz: "Religion as Cultural System" (1966)

**Substantive Elements:**

**Religion Is:**
1. System of symbols
2. Establishes powerful, pervasive moods and motivations
3. Formulates conceptions of general order of existence
4. Clothes these conceptions with aura of factuality
5. Moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic

**Key Concepts:**

**Symbols:**
- Communicate worldview
- Create ethos (moral/aesthetic style)

**Worldview:**
- Cognitive framework
- How world IS

**Ethos:**
- Values, how should live

**Religion Synthesizes:**
- Worldview + ethos
- IS and OUGHT
- Makes sense of suffering, evil, death

**Example: Balinese Cockfight:**
- Not "religion" proper
- But cultural performance
- Symbolic system
- Shows Geertz's approach

**Strengths:**
- Rich, textured
- Culture-centered
- Not just belief, but meaning

**Critiques:**
- Text-centered (ignores practice, power)
- Static
- Intellectualist (meaning over emotion, body)

## Functional Definitions: What Religion Does

### Émile Durkheim: "Elementary Forms of Religious Life" (1912)

**Functionalist Approach:**
- Don't define religion by content (gods, etc.)
- Define by what it DOES for society

**Religion = Society Worshipping Itself:**

**Key Argument:**
- Totems (Australian Aboriginals) represent clan
- Worship totem = worship society
- Religion creates social solidarity
- Collective effervescence (group rituals)

**Sacred vs. Profane:**

**The Fundamental Distinction:**

**Sacred:**
- Set apart, forbidden
- Dangerous, powerful
- Must be protected
- Collective, social

**Profane:**
- Ordinary, everyday
- Utilitarian
- Individual

**Religion:**
- Unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things
- Unite adherents into moral community (church)

**Function:**
- Social cohesion
- Collective conscience
- Moral solidarity
- Maintains social order

**Example: Arunta (Australian Aboriginals):**
- Totem = animal/plant associated with clan
- Rituals honor totem
- But really, honoring clan itself
- Strengthens group bonds

**Strengths:**
- Focus on social dimension
- Religion as integrative
- Explains persistence

**Critiques:**
- Functionalism (assumes social harmony)
- Ignores conflict, change
- Religion can divide, not just unite
- Reductionist (religion = society)

### Bronislaw Malinowski: "Magic, Science, Religion" (1948)

**Religion Meets Psychological Needs:**

**Anxiety and Uncertainty:**
- Humans face death, unpredictability
- Religion provides comfort
- Deals with emotional crises

**Function:**
- Reduces anxiety
- Coping mechanism
- Life crises (birth, death, illness)

**Trobriand Fishing:**
- Lagoon fishing (safe, predictable) → no magic
- Open sea fishing (dangerous, uncertain) → lots of magic
- Magic when control limited

**Religion vs. Magic:**
- Religion = social, sacred
- Magic = individual, instrumental
- Both functional (reduce anxiety)

**Strengths:**
- Psychological dimension
- Empirical examples
- Explains persistence

**Critiques:**
- Reductionist (religion = coping)
- Ignores meaning
- Assumes humans need religion

## Symbolic/Interpretive: What Religion Means

### Clifford Geertz (Revisited)

**Religion as Meaning System:**
- Provides framework for understanding
- Makes sense of suffering
- Orders chaos
- Cultural system

**Not Just Social Function:**
- Deeply meaningful
- Existential questions
- Coherent worldview

### Victor Turner: Symbols and Ritual

**Symbols are Multivocal:**
- Multiple meanings
- Condensed significance
- Ritual symbols powerful

**Ndembu Rituals:**
- Mudyi tree (milk tree)
- White sap = mother's milk
- Represents:
  - Matriliny
  - Motherhood
  - Ndembu society
  - Unity

**Turner's Insight:**
- Symbols unite diverse meanings
- Physiological, social, cosmic levels
- Ritual manipulates symbols

**More on Turner in Ritual Theory file.**

## Critical Approaches: "Religion" as Western Construct

### Talal Asad: "The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category" (1983)

**Critique of Universal "Religion":**

**Argument:**
- "Religion" is modern Western category
- Emerged from specific Christian history
- Imposed on non-Western contexts
- Not universal

**History:**
- Medieval Christianity: no separate "religion" sphere
- Modern West: religion privatized, separated from politics
- This separation then applied universally

**Problem:**
- Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism don't separate religion/politics/society
- "Religion" as bounded sphere is Christian/Western
- Anthropologists impose this category

**Implication:**
- Can't have universal definition
- Must study how "religion" produced historically
- Power in categorization

**Not Saying "Religion Doesn't Exist":**
- Saying category itself has history
- Must be critical of universalizing

### David Chidester: "Savage Systems" (1996)

**Colonial Construction:**
- Europeans debated: do "savages" have religion?
- First denied religion
- Then "discovered" religion
- Categories imposed

**Example: Zulu:**
- Missionaries couldn't find "religion"
- Eventually "found" it
- But shaped by Christian assumptions

**Power:**
- Defining religion = power
- Who counts as "religious"?
- Comparative religion assumes commensurability

## Sacred and Profane: Durkheim's Fundamental Distinction

### The Dichotomy

**Durkheim:**
- All religions distinguish sacred from profane
- Most basic classification

**Sacred:**
- Set apart, forbidden
- Elicits awe, respect
- Protected by taboos
- Collective
- Transcendent
- Represents social ideals

**Profane:**
- Ordinary, everyday
- Utilitarian
- Individual
- Immanent
- Mundane reality

**Not Good vs. Evil:**
- Sacred can be benevolent OR dangerous
- Taboo (tapu) = sacred, forbidden
- Profane = neutral

### Examples Worldwide

> **Polynesian Tapu**
>
> - Chiefs highly tapu (sacred)
> - Can't touch, stand higher than, cross shadow
> - Food chief touches becomes tapu
> - Violations cause supernatural harm
> - Separation of sacred person from profane

> **Jewish Kashrut (Dietary Laws)**
>
> - Mary Douglas, "Purity and Danger" (1966)
> - Clean vs. unclean animals
> - Not arbitrary—symbolic system
> - Separates categories
> - Maintains boundaries
> - Kosher = proper categories, pure
> - Pig, shellfish = category violations, impure

> **Hindu Purity/Pollution**
>
> - Louis Dumont
> - Caste system
> - Brahmins (high) = pure
> - Dalits (low) = polluted
> - Elaborate avoidance rules
> - Bathing, food restrictions
> - Sacred/profane as hierarchy

> **Navajo Hózhǫ́**
>
> - Balance, beauty, harmony = sacred
> - Disorder, ugliness = dangerous
> - Rituals restore hózhǫ́
> - Not separate sphere—infuses life

### Critique of Dichotomy

**Too Rigid?**
- Not always clear boundary
- Gradations
- Context-dependent

**William Robertson Smith:**
- Actually, sacred and profane intertwined
- Ritual moves between

**Jonathan Z. Smith:**
- "Sacred is...a category of emplacement"
- Created through ritual action
- Not inherent property

**But Useful:**
- Helps identify what matters
- All societies distinguish somehow
- Even if not absolute

## Buddhism: A Challenge to Definitions?

**Problem for Substantive Definitions:**
- No creator god (many forms)
- No supreme being worship
- Focus on enlightenment, cessation

**Durkheim's Response:**
- Buddhism still has sacred/profane
- Buddha, sangha (community), dharma = sacred
- Still creates moral community

**Melford Spiro:**
- "Nibbanic Buddhism" (elite, philosophical)
- "Kammatic Buddhism" (popular, merit-making, spirits)
- Latter fits definitions better

**Steven Collins:**
- Nirvana = sacred goal
- Path, practices = sacred
- Works as religion

**Insight:**
- Definitions based on theism too narrow
- Buddhism shows religion broader than "belief in gods"

---

## Defining Religion: Current Consensus

**No Single Definition:**
- Different approaches useful for different purposes
- Context-dependent

**Most Anthropologists:**
- Avoid strict definition
- Study what people call "religious"
- Attend to local categories
- Critical of "religion" as universal

**Useful Elements:**
1. **Sacred/profane distinction** (Durkheim)
2. **Meaning systems** (Geertz)
3. **Ritual practice** (not just belief)
4. **Community dimension** (moral/social)
5. **Transcendent reference** (ultimate concerns)
6. **Power and politics** (Asad)

**Avoid:**
- Ethnocentrism (Christian models)
- Functionalism (religion just for cohesion)
- Intellectualism (just beliefs)
- Essentialism (universal essence)

## Religion vs. Magic vs. Science

**Classic Distinction (Frazer, Malinowski):**

**Magic:**
- Instrumental (get results)
- Mechanical (spells, rituals work automatically)
- Coercive (force supernatural)
- Individual
- Pseudo-science

**Religion:**
- Moral, sacred
- Supplication (ask gods)
- Social, collective
- Worship

**Science:**
- Empirical, rational
- Testable
- Secular

**Critique:**
- Oversimplified
- All cultures mix elements
- "Magic" often pejorative
- Western bias (separate spheres)

**Better Approach:**
- All societies have techniques for intervention
- All have ultimate concerns
- All have empirical knowledge
- Boundaries blurred

**More in Magic, Religion, Science file.**

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is "religion" a useful universal category, or Western imposition?

**Question 2:** Can secular ideologies (nationalism, Marxism) be "religions"?

**Question 3:** Does religion need gods, or can atheistic Buddhism count?

**Question 4:** Is the sacred/profane distinction truly universal?

**Question 5:** What makes something "sacred" for you?

## For Further Exploration

**Ritual Theory:**
- [[ritual_theory.md]]: Van Gennep, Turner, Rappaport, Bell

**Specific Practices:**
- [[magic_religion_science.md]]: Magic, shamanism, spirit possession
- [[myth_and_cosmology.md]]: Creation stories, worldviews

**Classic Texts:**
- Durkheim, Émile. (1912). *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life*
- Geertz, Clifford. (1966). "Religion as a Cultural System"
- Asad, Talal. (1983). "The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category"

**Remember:** Defining religion is contested—no single definition satisfies all cases. Substantive definitions focus on supernatural beings (Tylor), but exclude Buddhism. Functional definitions emphasize social cohesion (Durkheim) or psychological comfort (Malinowski), but reduce religion to its effects. Symbolic definitions explore meaning (Geertz), but can be too intellectual. Critical approaches (Asad) question whether "religion" is universal category or Western construct. Sacred/profane distinction (Durkheim) remains useful but not absolute. Most anthropologists avoid rigid definition, study local categories, attend to practice and power, and critique Christian bias. Understanding definitional debates reveals assumptions about what religion is and does.
