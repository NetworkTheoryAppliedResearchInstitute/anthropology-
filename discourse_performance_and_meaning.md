# Discourse, Performance, and Meaning: Language in Action

---

## Ethnography of Communication

### Dell Hymes: Speaking

**Beyond Grammar:**
- Knowing language ≠ knowing how to use it
- **Communicative competence** (not just linguistic competence)
- Cultural rules (when, how, what to say)

**SPEAKING Framework:**

**S**etting: Physical context  
**P**articipants: Who's involved  
**E**nds: Goals, outcomes  
**A**ct sequence: Form and content  
**K**ey: Tone, manner  
**I**nstrumentalities: Channel, forms of speech  
**N**orms: Social rules  
**G**enre: Type of event  

**Example: Classroom**
- Setting: School
- Participants: Teacher, students
- Ends: Education
- Act sequence: Lecture, questions
- Key: Formal
- Instrumentalities: Spoken (or written)
- Norms: Raise hand, wait to be called
- Genre: Lesson

**Insight:**
- Same language, different cultures = different rules
- Cross-cultural misunderstanding

---

## Speech Events and Acts

### Units of Analysis

**Speech Event:**
- Culturally recognized activity
- Lecture, greeting, joke, sermon, interview

**Speech Act:**
- Minimal unit (utterance with function)
- Request, command, promise, apology

**J.L. Austin: How to Do Things with Words**
- Performative utterances
- Saying = doing
- "I now pronounce you married" (creates state)
- "I promise" (commits speaker)

---

## Silence

### When Not Speaking Matters

**Western Apache (Keith Basso):**
- Silence = appropriate (many contexts)
  - Meeting strangers
  - Courting (early stages)
  - Reunions (after absence)
  - Anger
  - Mourning
  - Being with someone who is sad

**Contrast:**
- English speakers (US): Fill silence (uncomfortable)

**Insight:**
- Silence ≠ absence of communication
- Meaningful

**Finnish:**
- Comfortable with silence (less small talk)

---

## Turn-Taking

### Conversation Organization

**Rules:**
- Who speaks when?
- Overlaps, interruptions (acceptable?)

**English (US):**
- Minimal gaps (smooth transitions)
- One speaker at a time (norm)
- Overlaps = interruptions (rude, except excitement)

**Other Cultures:**
- High-involvement style (Tannen): Overlaps normal (enthusiasm)
  - Jewish New Yorkers
  - Some Mediterranean
- Longer pauses acceptable (Athabaskan)

**Cross-Cultural Miscommunication:**
- Fast turners think slow turners = hesitant, withholding
- Slow turners think fast turners = rude, dominating

---

## Politeness

### Face-Saving

**Penelope Brown & Stephen Levinson:**
- Universal: **Face** (public self-image)
  - Positive face: Want to be liked
  - Negative face: Want freedom, autonomy

**Politeness Strategies:**
- Protect face (self, other)

**Face-Threatening Acts (FTAs):**
- Requests, orders, criticisms
- Require mitigation

**Strategies:**

**Direct:**
- "Close the door."

**Positive Politeness:**
- Solidarity, familiarity
- "Hey buddy, close the door, would you?"

**Negative Politeness:**
- Deference, distance
- "I'm sorry to bother you, but could you possibly close the door?"

**Off-Record:**
- Indirect
- "It's cold in here." (hint)

**Cultural Variation:**
- What counts as polite?
- Direct = rude or honest?
- Indirect = polite or evasive?

---

## Honorifics

### Marking Social Relationships

**Definition:**
- Grammatical markers (respect, status)

**Japanese:**
- Elaborate system
- Verb endings, pronouns
- **Levels:**
  - Plain (intimate, equal)
  - Polite (*-masu*)
  - Honorific (elevate addressee)
  - Humble (lower self)

**Example:**
- "Eat": *taberu* (plain), *tabemasu* (polite), *meshiagaru* (honorific), *itadaku* (humble)

**Korean:**
- Similar (speech levels)

**European Languages:**
- T/V distinction (tu/vous, du/Sie, tú/usted)
- Intimate vs. formal "you"

**Power and Solidarity (Brown & Gilman):**
- Mutual T: Intimacy
- Mutual V: Respect, distance
- Non-reciprocal: Power (superior gives T, receives V)

---

## Narrative Analysis

### Storytelling

**Importance:**
- Universal (all cultures)
- Identity, memory
- Moral lessons
- Entertainment

---

## Labov: Oral Narratives

### Structure

**Study:**
- African American adolescents (NYC)
- "Danger of death" stories

**Narrative Structure:**

1. **Abstract**: What is this about?
2. **Orientation**: Who, when, where?
3. **Complicating action**: Then what happened?
4. **Evaluation**: So what? (significance)
5. **Resolution**: What finally happened?
6. **Coda**: Return to present

**Not Universal:**
- Western pattern
- Other cultures organize differently

---

## Cultural Variation in Narrative

### Different Styles

**Michaels (1981): Sharing Time**
- First-grade classroom (US)
- Black vs. white children

**White Children:**
- Topic-centered (linear, single event)
- "Yesterday I went to the zoo. I saw lions. It was fun."

**Black Children:**
- Topic-associating (episodic, thematic links)
- Links not always explicit (to teacher)
- "My puppy, he got in a fight. And my cousin, she has a puppy too..."

**Teacher Response:**
- Topic-centered = praised ("clear")
- Topic-associating = redirected ("stick to the point")

**Implication:**
- Cultural mismatch (not deficiency)
- School favors one style

---

## Discourse Analysis

### Beyond Sentences

**Definition:**
- Study of language use (extended texts, conversations)
- Coherence, cohesion
- Context

**James Gee: Big D vs. Little d**
- **Discourse** (big D): Way of being in the world
  - Identity, ideology
  - Includes language + practices + beliefs
- **discourse** (little d): Connected stretches of language

**Example: "Being a Scientist"**
- Discourse: Lab coat, jargon, empiricism, objectivity, peer review
- discourse: Research paper (genre)

---

## Conversation Analysis (CA)

### Micro-Level Structure

**Origins:**
- Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff, Gail Jefferson (1960s-70s)

**Method:**
- Detailed transcription (pauses, overlaps, intonation)
- Identify patterns

**Findings:**

**Adjacency Pairs:**
- Question → Answer
- Greeting → Greeting
- Invitation → Accept/Decline

**Preference Organization:**
- Preferred: Direct, quick ("Yes, I'll come")
- Dispreferred: Delayed, hedged ("Well, I'd love to, but...")

**Repair:**
- Self-repair: Speaker corrects self
- Other-repair: Listener corrects

**Turn-Taking:**
- Transition-relevance places (TRPs)
- No gap, no overlap (ideal, not always)

---

## Performativity

### Language as Action

**J.L. Austin:**
- Performative utterances (see above)

**Judith Butler:**
- Gender performativity
- Gender = repeated performance (not essence)
- Language enacts identity

**Example:**
- "It's a girl!" (at birth)
  - Begins gendering process
  - Iterative (repeated)
  - Normative (constrained by norms)

**Implications:**
- Identity = doing (not being)
- Language = constitutive (creates reality)

---

## Ritual Language

### Special Speech

**Characteristics:**
- Formulaic
- Sacred, powerful
- Often archaic

**Examples:**

**Religious:**
- Prayer, blessing, liturgy
- "In the name of the Father, and of the Son..."
- Pali (Theravada Buddhism, liturgical)
- Sanskrit (Hindu mantras)
- Church Slavonic (Orthodox)

**Legal:**
- Oath: "I swear to tell the truth..."
- Contract language (legalese)

**Political:**
- Oath of office

**Maurice Bloch:**
- Formalized language = power
- Restricts response (limited options)
- Example: Yes/No (oath)

---

## Gesture and Embodiment

### Beyond Words

**Multimodality:**
- Language + gesture + facial expression + posture

**David McNeill:**
- Gesture types:
  - **Iconic**: Resemble referent (hand shape = object)
  - **Metaphoric**: Abstract concepts (timeline = hand movement)
  - **Deictic**: Pointing
  - **Beat**: Rhythmic (emphasis)

**Gesture-Speech Relationship:**
- Synchronized
- Integrated (meaning)
- Not redundant (adds information)

**Example:**
- "He went up the stairs" + hand spirals upward (iconic)

---

## Cross-Cultural Gesture

### Variation

**"OK" Sign (thumb-index circle):**
- US: OK
- France: Zero, worthless
- Brazil: Vulgar
- Japan: Money

**Thumbs Up:**
- US, Europe: Good, approval
- Middle East, parts of South America: Offensive

**Gesture Systems:**
- Deaf sign languages (full languages, not gestures)
- Home sign (invented by deaf children, no access to sign language)

---

## Prosody

### Intonation, Stress, Rhythm

**Functions:**
- Emotion, attitude
- Grammar (questions vs. statements)
- Emphasis

**Example (English):**
- "I didn't say he stole the money."
  - Stress *I*: (someone else did)
  - Stress *didn't*: (I didn't!)
  - Stress *say*: (I implied)
  - Stress *he*: (someone else)
  - Stress *stole*: (he borrowed)
  - Stress *the*: (some money, not the money)
  - Stress *money*: (something else)

**Cross-Cultural:**
- Intonation patterns vary
- Misinterpretation (e.g., "rude," "bored")

---

## Digital Communication

### New Modalities

**Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC):**
- Email, chat, social media, texting

**Characteristics:**
- Written (but informal, conversational)
- Asynchronous (email) or synchronous (chat)
- Multimodal (text + image + emoji + GIF)

---

## Emoji and Emoticons

### Visual Paralanguage

**Function:**
- Convey tone (lacking in text)
- Emotion, attitude
- :) = smile, sarcasm, playfulness

**Evolution:**
- Emoticons (text-based) → Emoji (graphical)

**Variation:**
- Cultural (meanings differ)
- Generational (boomers vs. Gen Z)

**Example:**
- 😂 (face with tears of joy)
  - Millennials: Funny
  - Gen Z: Cringe (outdated)
  - Use 💀 (skull) instead

---

## Memes

### Digital Folklore

**Definition:**
- Unit of culture (Dawkins)
- Digital: Image + text (often)
- Remixed, shared

**Characteristics:**
- Intertextual (references)
- Participatory
- Rapid spread, evolution

**Linguistic Features:**
- Non-standard grammar ("I can has cheezburger?")
- Abbreviations (lol, omg)
- In-group markers

**Functions:**
- Humor
- Social commentary
- Identity (subcultures)

---

## Hashtags

### Indexing and Activism

**Function:**
- Categorize, search
- Create publics

**Activism:**
- #BlackLivesMatter
- #MeToo
- #ClimateStrike

**Linguistic:**
- Compound words (no spaces)
- Creative (#SelfieSunday, #ThrowbackThursday)

---

## Code-Switching Online

### Multilingual Digital Spaces

**Translanguaging:**
- Fluid use of multiple languages
- Not compartmentalized

**Example (Spanglish Twitter):**
- "Going to la tienda for some groceries, brb"

**Platform Variation:**
- LinkedIn (professional, formal)
- Instagram (visual, casual)
- Twitter (brief, witty)

**Identity Performance:**
- Different selves (different platforms)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is silence ever communicative?

**Question 2:** Are emoji a new form of writing or a return to pictographs?

**Question 3:** Does digital communication change how we think?

**Question 4:** Can you be "yourself" online, or are all identities performed?

**Question 5:** Do memes constitute a new form of folklore?
