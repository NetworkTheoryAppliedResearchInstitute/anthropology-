# Collaborative and Participatory Approaches: Decolonizing Method

---

## From Extraction to Partnership

Traditional anthropological research has been **extractive:**
- Anthropologist enters community
- Gathers data
- Leaves
- Writes for academic audience
- Builds career on others' knowledge
- Community gets little benefit

**Collaborative and participatory methods** challenge this model:
- Community involvement in research design
- Shared decision-making
- Joint data collection and analysis
- Co-authorship
- Research serves community needs
- Knowledge remains with community

This isn't just being "nice"—it's **decolonizing research practice**.

## What Is Collaborative Research?

### Spectrum of Collaboration

**Not Binary (Collaborative vs. Not):**

**Low Collaboration:**
- Anthropologist designs, conducts, writes alone
- Informants provide data
- Community consulted minimally

**Medium Collaboration:**
- Community input on research questions
- Community members as research assistants
- Community review of findings
- Shared presentations

**High Collaboration:**
- Community co-designs research
- Community members as co-researchers
- Shared analysis
- Co-authorship
- Community owns data and products

**Full Community Control:**
- Community initiates research
- Anthropologist as consultant/facilitator
- Community directs all aspects
- Community owns everything

### Key Principles

**1. Shared Authority:**
Not anthropologist as expert—community as experts on their own lives.

**2. Reciprocity:**
Research must benefit community, not just researcher.

**3. Accountability:**
Researcher accountable to community, not just academia.

**4. Respect:**
For community knowledge, priorities, protocols.

**5. Sustainability:**
Build community capacity, leave infrastructure.

## Participatory Action Research (PAR)

### Origin and Philosophy

**Roots:**
- Latin American popular education (Paulo Freire)
- Community organizing
- Social justice movements

**Core Idea:**
Research should transform, not just document. Knowledge is for action.

### Characteristics

**1. Problem-Focused:**
Addresses community-identified issue, not academic curiosity.

**2. Participatory:**
Community members as co-researchers, not subjects.

**3. Action-Oriented:**
Goal is change, not just knowledge.

**4. Iterative:**
Cycles of reflection and action.

**5. Empowering:**
Builds community capacity and agency.

### PAR Cycle

**1. Identify Problem:**
With community—what needs addressing?

**2. Plan Research:**
Together—what questions, what methods?

**3. Collect Data:**
Community members involved in data gathering.

**4. Analyze:**
Shared interpretation—what does data mean?

**5. Act:**
Implement changes based on findings.

**6. Reflect:**
Evaluate—what worked? What next?

**7. Repeat:**
New cycle with new insights.

> **Example: Health Access PAR Project**
>
> **Problem:** Immigrant community lacks health access.
>
> **Process:**
> - Community identifies barriers (language, cost, transportation, discrimination)
> - Design survey with community input
> - Community members conduct surveys (peers interviewing peers)
> - Joint analysis sessions
> - Findings presented to health department
> - Community advocates for interpretation services, clinic hours
> - Evaluation—did access improve?
> - Next cycle addresses remaining barriers

### Advantages

**Community Benefits:**
- Addresses real needs
- Builds skills and knowledge
- Empowers community action
- Immediate practical results

**Research Benefits:**
- Better access (community trust)
- More accurate data (peers gathering info)
- Contextual understanding
- Sustainable relationships

### Challenges

**Time-Intensive:**
Collaboration takes time—meetings, consensus, training.

**Multiple Agendas:**
Community priorities may differ from academic interests.

**Power Sharing:**
Requires anthropologist ceding control.

**Institutional Barriers:**
Universities want solo-authored publications, fast results.

## Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)

### Similar to PAR, More Formalized

**Often Used In:**
- Public health
- Medical anthropology
- Applied research

### Principles (Often Cited):

**1. Community is Unit of Identity:**
Define community together.

**2. Builds on Strengths:**
Assets-based, not deficit-focused.

**3. Facilitates Partnership:**
All partners contribute equitably.

**4. Integrates Knowledge:**
Academic AND community knowledge valued.

**5. Balances Knowledge and Action:**
Both generate findings and address problem.

**6. Problem-Focused:**
Community-identified issues.

**7. Ecological Perspective:**
Multiple levels (individual, community, policy).

**8. Involves Systems Development:**
Iterative, cyclical.

**9. Disseminates to All:**
Share findings with community, not just academia.

**10. Long-Term Commitment:**
Sustained partnership.

### Example Structures

**Community Advisory Board (CAB):**
- Community representatives guide research
- Meet regularly
- Approve protocols, findings, publications
- Provide community perspective

**Steering Committee:**
- Shared leadership
- Community members and researchers
- Make decisions together

**Community Researchers:**
- Training community members in research
- Hiring as staff
- Peer-to-peer data collection

## Indigenous Research Methodologies

### Decolonizing Research

**Linda Tuhiwai Smith's Framework:**

**Indigenous research must:**
1. Respect indigenous sovereignty
2. Follow indigenous protocols
3. Serve indigenous self-determination
4. Center indigenous epistemologies
5. Be accountable to communities
6. Build indigenous capacity

### Indigenous Research Principles

**Many Indigenous Groups Developed Principles:**

**Example: First Nations Principles (OCAP®):**

**Ownership:** Community owns data about itself.

**Control:** Community controls data collection, use.

**Access:** Community decides who accesses data.

**Possession:** Community physically holds data.

**Applied:**
- All research requires community approval
- Data stored on community servers
- Community can veto publication
- Researchers are guests, not owners

### Indigenous Protocols

**Respect Specific Protocols:**

**Example: Some Indigenous Communities Require:**
- Offerings (tobacco, gifts) when asking knowledge
- Elder approval for certain topics
- Seasonal timing (don't research during sacred times)
- Gender restrictions (some knowledge women only/men only)
- Not recording certain ceremonies
- Not publishing sacred knowledge

**Varies by Community:**
Protocols aren't universal—learn specific community expectations.

### Indigenous-Led Research

**Ideal:** Indigenous researchers studying their own communities.

**Advantages:**
- Insider knowledge
- Language fluency
- Cultural understanding
- Community trust
- Accountability

**Growing:** More indigenous scholars in anthropology.

**Non-Indigenous Researchers:**
Must follow indigenous protocols, collaborate, be accountable.

## Co-Production of Knowledge

### Moving Beyond "Informants"

**Traditional:**
- Anthropologist = expert
- Community members = informants (providing data)

**Collaborative:**
- Community members = co-researchers
- Shared expertise
- Joint knowledge creation

### Methods

**1. Collaborative Ethnography:**
Community members involved in:
- Defining questions
- Collecting data
- Interpreting findings
- Writing
- Presenting

**Example:** Luke Lassiter's work with Kiowa—collaborative writing, shared authority.

**2. Co-Authorship:**
Community members as named authors.

**Challenges:**
- Academic conventions (who gets authorship?)
- Intellectual property
- Credit and careers

**3. Participatory Visual Methods:**
- Photovoice (community members photograph their worlds)
- Community video
- Participatory mapping
- Community-created exhibitions

**Community tells own story through images.**

**4. Community Validation:**
- Share drafts with community
- Incorporate feedback
- Get approval before publication

**Not Just Token:**
Genuine willingness to change based on feedback.

## Ethical Frameworks

### Do No Harm

**Research Should Not:**
- Exploit communities
- Extract without giving back
- Expose to risks
- Misrepresent
- Serve only researcher's interests

### Benefits Community

**Research Should:**
- Address community needs
- Build capacity
- Leave resources
- Advocate (if desired)
- Serve community self-determination

### Informed Consent as Ongoing

**Not One-Time:**
- Continuous dialogue
- Consent can be withdrawn
- Adapt as understanding grows

**Community Consent:**
Not just individual—collective approval.

### Data Sovereignty

**Community Controls:**
- What data collected
- How data stored
- Who accesses data
- How data used
- Publication decisions

**Especially Critical:**
- Genetic data
- Sacred knowledge
- Sensitive information
- Historical trauma

**Collaboration Takes:**
- More time (meetings, consensus)
- More resources (training, compensation)
- More flexibility

**Institutional Pressure:**
- "Publish or perish"
- Tenure clocks

**Tension:** Academic demands vs. ethical collaboration.

### 2. Different Goals

**Academic Goals:**
- Publications
- Theoretical contributions
- Career advancement

**Community Goals:**
- Practical solutions
- Community benefit
- Self-determination

**May Conflict:**
What community wants published may differ from what advances academic career.

### 3. Power Imbalances

**Despite Best Intentions:**
- Anthropologist has institutional power
- Academic credentials
- Control over writing
- Career incentives

**Can't Fully Erase:**
Power imbalances persistent.

**Can Mitigate:**
Transparency, accountability, sharing resources.

### 4. Representation

**Who Represents Community?**
- Leadership may not represent all
- Internal conflicts and disagreements
- Whose voices get heard?

**Avoid:**
Treating community as monolithic.

### 5. Sustainability

**What Happens When Anthropologist Leaves?**

**Build:**
- Local capacity
- Training
- Infrastructure
- Ongoing relationships

**Not:**
- Dependency
- Short-term projects
- Abandoned initiatives

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can truly collaborative research satisfy academic requirements (publications, tenure)?

**Question 2:** Who benefits more from collaborative research—researcher or community?

**Question 3:** Is it possible to fully decolonize anthropological method, or are power imbalances inevitable?

**Question 4:** Should anthropologists only study with community approval, even if that limits research?

**Question 5:** Where's the line between collaboration and co-optation?

**Remember:** Collaborative and participatory methods aren't just ethical nice-ities—they're fundamental transformations of anthropological practice. They challenge anthropology's extractive colonial legacy by centering community sovereignty, sharing power, and making research serve communities. This is harder, slower, and requires humility. But it produces better research (more accurate, contextual, trusted) AND serves justice. The question isn't whether to collaborate but how deeply, how genuinely, how sustainably. Decolonizing anthropology requires decolonizing method—moving from studying people to working with them.
