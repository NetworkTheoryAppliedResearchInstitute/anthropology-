---

## Africa Today: Beyond Stereotypes

### Challenging Images

**Reality:**
- Complex, diverse
- Rapidly changing
- Vibrant cities
- Innovation, creativity
- Agency (not victims)

**Single Story Problem (Chimamanda Adichie):**
- "The danger of a single story"
- Africa = diverse (not monolithic)
- Multiple narratives

---

## Post-Colonial States

### Independence and After

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is urbanization a crisis or an opportunity for Africa?

**Question 3:** Is foreign aid helpful or harmful?

**Question 4:** Is China's involvement in Africa neo-colonialism or partnership?

**Question 5:** What does "development" mean from an African perspective?
