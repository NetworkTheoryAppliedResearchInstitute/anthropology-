**"Totemism" (1962):**
- Not special religious form

**Overturns:**
- "Primitive religion" category
- Shows universal cognitive process

### Ethnographic Reality

**Variable:**
- Some groups have totems

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is "African religion" too broad a category (like "European religion")?

**Question 2:** How do we study religions critically without imposing Western categories?

**Question 3:** Are ancestors "worshipped" or "venerated"—and does the distinction matter?

**Question 4:** Can witchcraft beliefs coexist with modern science and education?

**Question 5:** What role does divination play in your decision-making?

**Remember:** African religions are diverse, sophisticated systems with complex cosmologies (Yoruba orishas), divination (Ifa, poison oracle), ancestor veneration, and witchcraft beliefs. Yoruba religion features hundreds of orishas with distinct personalities, accessed through divination, sacrifice, and possession. Ancestors are central across Africa—mediating between living and divine, enforcing morality, legitimizing land claims. Vodun in Benin influenced diaspora traditions. Divination systems provide guidance and resolve uncertainty. Witchcraft explains misfortune and enforces social norms. These aren't "primitive" beliefs but coherent worldviews with philosophical depth, adaptive strategies, and ongoing vitality. Understanding African religions challenges Western stereotypes and reveals humanity's diverse ways of engaging the sacred.
