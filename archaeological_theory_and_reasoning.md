# Archaeological Theory and Reasoning

---

## What Is Archaeology?

### Studying the Past Through Material Remains

**Definition:**
- Study of human past through material culture
- "Things people made and used"
- Artifacts, features, ecofacts, sites

**Time Depth:**
- Prehistory (no writing)
- Historic (with documents)
- Can study any period

**Relationship to Anthropology:**
- One of four fields (American tradition)
- Holistic approach
- Bio-cultural perspective
- Human variation and adaptation

**What Makes It Unique:**
- Material evidence (not texts alone)
- Deep time (millions of years to yesterday)
- Context crucial
- Destruction of evidence (excavation unrepeatable)

---

## The Archaeological Record

### What Survives?

**Material Culture:**

**Artifacts:**
- Portable objects made/modified by humans
- Stone tools, pottery, metal objects, beads
- Most common archaeological evidence

**Features:**
- Non-portable structures
- Hearths, walls, postholes, burials
- "Artifacts that can't be moved"

**Ecofacts:**
- Natural objects used/affected by humans
- Animal bones (faunal remains)
- Plant remains (botanical, paleoethnobotany)
- Pollen, charcoal

**Sites:**
- Locations of human activity
- Accumulation of artifacts/features
- Can be settlements, kill sites, quarries, ritual spaces

**Landscapes:**
- Broader patterns
- Settlement systems
- Trade routes
- Land modification

## Preservation Bias

### What's Missing?

**Organic Materials:**
- Wood, leather, textiles, rope
- Decay (bacteria, fungi)
- Rare preservation (dry, frozen, waterlogged, anaerobic)

**Consequences:**
- Stone tools overrepresented
- "Stone Age" emphasis
- But: stone was minority of tools
- Wooden tools, baskets, etc. invisible

**Exceptional Preservation:**

**Ötzi the Iceman:**
- Ice preserved everything
- Clothing, tools, weapons, body
- Reveals complexity (copper axe, bow, arrows, leather quiver, birchbark containers, medicinal plants)

**Egyptian Tombs:**
- Dry climate
- Organic materials survive
- Furniture, textiles, food

**Bog Bodies:**
- Anaerobic (no oxygen)
- Tannins preserve
- Bodies, clothing, last meals

**Underwater Sites:**
- Shipwrecks
- Lake dwellings
- Low oxygen

**Lesson:**
- Archaeology sees fraction of past
- "Tip of the iceberg"
- Most behavior invisible

---

## Archaeological Inference

### From Objects to Behavior

**The Problem:**
- We have objects (static)
- Want to know behavior (dynamic)
- Gap between material and meaning

**Analogy:**
- Use present to interpret past
- Ethnographic analogy
- Experimental archaeology
- Middle-range theory

---

## Uniformitarianism

### The Present Is Key to the Past

**Principle:**
- Same processes operate now as past
- Geology (Charles Lyell, 19th C)
- Archaeology adopted

**Examples:**
- Rivers deposit sediments (today and past)
- Fire leaves charcoal
- Stone flakes in predictable ways

**Limits:**
- Human behavior NOT uniform
- Cultural variation
- Must be careful with analogies

---

## Middle-Range Theory

### Linking Static to Dynamic

**Lewis Binford:**
- "New Archaeology" (1960s)
- Middle-range theory
- Link material remains to behavior
- Experimental, ethnoarchaeology

**Goal:**
- Establish laws/regularities
- Test with ethnography
- Apply to past

**Examples:**
- How do bones become deposited? (taphonomy)
- How do stone tools break? (use-wear)
- What creates site formation? (refuse disposal)

**Ethnoarchaeology:**
- Study living peoples
- Document material correlates of behavior
- Not assuming past = present
- But: establish range of possibilities

---

## Theoretical Frameworks

### How to Interpret the Past

### Culture History (Early 20th C)

**Approach:**
- Describe artifact types
- Trace distributions (space, time)
- Build chronologies
- Migration/diffusion explanations

**Methods:**
- Typology (classify artifacts)
- Seriation (order by style)
- Stratigraphy (layers)

**Key Figures:**
- V. Gordon Childe
- Alfred Kroeber

**Contributions:**
- Basic chronologies established
- Artifact catalogs
- Culture areas defined

**Critiques:**
- Descriptive not explanatory
- Assumed culture = ethnicity
- Migration overemphasized
- Static view

### Processual Archaeology (1960s-70s)

**"New Archaeology":**
- Lewis Binford, Kent Flannery
- Scientific approach
- Hypothesis testing
- Nomothetic (seek laws)
- Ecological, systems theory

**Questions:**
- Why did X happen?
- Process not just description
- Subsistence, adaptation, evolution

**Methods:**
- Quantitative
- Models (computer simulation)
- Environmental reconstruction
- Settlement pattern analysis

**Cultural Ecology:**
- Culture as adaptation
- Environment shapes behavior
- Materialist

**Contributions:**
- Rigorous methods
- Explanation not just description
- Ecological perspective
- Scientific standards

**Critiques:**
- Downplayed people/agency
- Environment deterministic
- Ignored ideology, symbols
- Positivist epistemology

### Post-Processual Archaeology (1980s+)

**Reaction:**
- Ian Hodder, Michael Shanks, Christopher Tilley
- Against processual scientism
- Meaning, symbols, ideology matter
- Multiple interpretations valid
- Reflexive

**Influences:**
- Postmodernism
- Interpretive anthropology (Geertz)
- Marxism, feminism, structuralism

**Emphases:**
- Agency (individuals matter)
- Meaning (symbolic)
- Context (interpretation contextual)
- Power, inequality
- Gender

**Critiques:**
- Relativism (anything goes?)
- Unscientific
- Navel-gazing

**Contributions:**
- Gender archaeology
- Ideology, ritual
- Reflexivity about bias
- Indigenous perspectives

### Contemporary Synthesis

**Today:**
- No single orthodoxy
- Draw from multiple frameworks
- Pragmatic
- Scientific rigor + interpretive nuance

**Active Areas:**
- Feminist archaeology
- Postcolonial archaeology
- Landscape archaeology
- Phenomenology (experience)
- Agent-based modeling
- Ancient DNA revolution
- Digital archaeology

---

## Agency and Structure

### People vs. Systems

**Tension:**
- Processual: systems, adaptation
- Post-processual: individuals, agency

**Practice Theory:**
- Pierre Bourdieu (sociology)
- Applied to archaeology
- Structure constrains but doesn't determine
- Individuals navigate, reproduce, change structures
- "Structuration" (Giddens)

**Archaeological Application:**
- Not passive adapters
- Nor free agents
- Constrained creativity
- Traditions reproduced through practice

---

## Feminist Archaeology

### Engendering the Past

**Problem:**
- Archaeology male-biased
- "Man the Hunter" scenarios
- Women invisible
- Tools = men, pots = women (assumptions)

**Margaret Conkey, Joan Gero:**
- "Engendering Archaeology" (1991)
- Gender not assumed
- Variation

**Questions:**
- How to identify gender archaeologically?
- Division of labor
- Status differences
- Ideologies

**Approaches:**
- Burial analysis (grave goods, isotopes for diet/mobility)
- Use-wear (who used tools?)
- Spatial analysis (activity areas)
- Representational art (ideologies)

**Challenges:**
- Sex ≠ gender
- Third genders
- Fluidity
- Don't project modern Western assumptions

---

## Cognitive Archaeology

### Thinking About Thought

**Goal:**
- Understand ancient minds
- Cognition, beliefs, worldviews

**Evidence:**
- Art, symbols
- Ritual sites
- Burial practices
- Architecture (cosmology encoded)

**Examples:**
- Paleolithic cave art (meaning? ritual?)
- Megalithic monuments (Stonehenge: cosmology, astronomy)
- Maya hieroglyphs, calendars (worldview)

**Colin Renfrew:**
- Pioneer cognitive archaeology
- "The Sapient Mind"

**Challenges:**
- Minds don't fossilize
- Interpretation subjective
- Multiple readings possible

---

## Landscape Archaeology

### Beyond Sites

**Approach:**
- Whole landscapes
- Not just sites in isolation
- Relationships (settlements, resources, monuments)
- Movement, viewsheds, experience

**Settlement Pattern Analysis:**
- Gordon Willey (1950s, Peru)
- Distribution of sites
- Hierarchy (size, complexity)
- Environmental zones

**Phenomenology:**
- Embodied experience
- How did people experience place?
- Sensory (sound, sight, movement)
- Christopher Tilley

**GIS (Geographic Information Systems):**
- Digital mapping
- Spatial analysis
- Predictive modeling
- Viewshed analysis

---

## Postcolonial Archaeology

### Decolonizing the Past

**Critiques:**
- Archaeology served colonialism
- Justified dispossession
- Silenced Indigenous voices
- Extractive

**Questions:**
- Who owns the past?
- Who interprets?
- For whose benefit?

**Collaborative Archaeology:**
- Work with descendant communities
- Co-produce knowledge
- Respectful
- Benefits shared

**Indigenous Archaeology:**
- Indigenous scholars
- Community-based
- Oral traditions integrated
- Challenge colonial narratives

**Repatriation:**
- Return artifacts, remains
- NAGPRA (US), similar laws elsewhere
- Ongoing debates

---

## Taphonomy

### Site Formation Processes

**Michael Schiffer:**
- Behavioral archaeology
- Formation processes

**Cultural Processes:**
- How people deposit, discard, curate
- Refuse disposal (primary vs. secondary)
- Abandonment
- Reuse

**Natural Processes:**
- Weathering, erosion
- Bioturbation (rodents, roots, worms)
- Fluvial (water movement)
- Volcanic (Pompeii)

**Post-Depositional:**
- What happens after burial?
- Diagenesis (chemical changes)
- Compression, mineralization

**Palimpsest:**
- Multiple occupations superimposed
- Hard to separate
- Time-averaged

**Lesson:**
- Archaeological record ≠ pristine snapshot
- Transformed, partial
- Must understand formation

---

## Analogy and Interpretation

### Using the Present

**Direct Historical Approach:**
- Work backward from known to unknown
- Ethnographic present → archaeological past
- Same region, cultural continuity

**General Analogy:**
- Cross-cultural
- Hunter-gatherers worldwide (similarities)
- Cautious (cultural variation)

**Relational Analogy:**
- Multiple lines of evidence
- Best fit

**Experimental Archaeology:**
- Replicate (stone tools, pottery, buildings)
- Test hypotheses
- Learn processes

**Ethnoarchaeology:**
- Observe living peoples
- Material correlates
- Refuse disposal, tool use, site structure

**Examples:**
- Richard Lee (Ju/'hoansi): hunter-gatherer archaeology
- Lewis Binford (Nunamiut): bone assemblages, hunting
- Carol Kramer (Iran): pottery use, discard

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can archaeology ever be truly scientific, or always interpretive?

**Question 2:** Whose past does archaeology study—everyone's or colonizers'?

**Question 3:** How much can we really know about ancient minds?

**Question 4:** Should archaeologists work with descendant communities always?

**Question 5:** Is preservation bias so severe we're fundamentally misunderstanding the past?

**Remember:** Archaeology studies human past through material remains—artifacts (portable), features (non-portable), ecofacts (natural objects), sites, landscapes. Preservation bias severe (organics decay, stone overrepresented, exceptional preservation Ötzi/Egyptian tombs/bog bodies reveals complexity). Archaeological inference bridges static objects to dynamic behavior—uniformitarianism (present→past), middle-range theory (Binford—ethnoarchaeology/experimental). Theoretical frameworks evolved: culture history (early 20th C descriptive typology), processual "New Archaeology" (1960s Binford scientific ecological systems), post-processual (1980s Hodder meaning/agency/symbols/reflexive), contemporary synthesis pragmatic. Feminist archaeology gender not assumed (Conkey & Gero). Cognitive archaeology ancient minds (art, ritual, cosmology). Landscape archaeology beyond sites (settlement patterns, phenomenology, GIS). Postcolonial archaeology decolonizing (collaborative, Indigenous archaeology, repatriation). Taphonomy site formation (Schiffer—cultural/natural processes, post-depositional, palimpsest). Analogy careful (direct historical, general, relational, experimental, ethnoarchaeology Binford Nunamiut bones). Understanding archaeological theory reveals how archaeologists think—interpretive challenges, preservation limits, multiple frameworks, ongoing debates science vs. interpretation, colonial legacy.
