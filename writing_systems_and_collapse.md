# Writing Systems and Collapse: Recording and Ending

---

## The Invention of Writing

### Why Writing Matters

**Transformative:**
- Record-keeping (permanent)
- Information storage
- Long-distance communication
- Accumulation of knowledge
- History (vs. prehistory)

**Literacy and Power:**
- Elite knowledge
- Scribal class
- Control of information

**Not Universal:**
- Many complex societies without writing
- Inka (khipu instead)
- Oral traditions powerful

---

## Independent Inventions of Writing

### Multiple Origins

**At Least 4-5 Independent Inventions:**

1. **Mesopotamia** (~3,300 BCE)
2. **Egypt** (~3,200 BCE, possibly independent or influenced?)
3. **China** (~1,200 BCE, oracle bones; earlier?)
4. **Mesoamerica** (~900 BCE, Zapotec/Olmec; Maya develops)
5. **Indus Valley?** (~2,600 BCE, undeciphered—is it writing?)

**Debated:**
- Easter Island (rongorongo, ~1200s CE?)
- Sub-Saharan Africa (independent or influenced?)

---

## Mesopotamian Cuneiform

### Wedge-Shaped Writing

**Origin:**
- ~3,300 BCE (Late Uruk period)
- Southern Mesopotamia (Sumer)

**Development:**

**Tokens:**
- Before writing
- Clay shapes (cones, spheres)
- Represent goods (grain, animals)
- Trade, accounting

**Envelopes:**
- Tokens enclosed in clay balls
- Marks on outside (what's inside)
- Problem: break to see
- Solution: marks alone suffice

**Pictographs:**
- ~3,300 BCE
- Simplified pictures
- Stylus on clay tablets
- Logographic (each sign = word)

**Cuneiform ("Wedge-Shaped"):**
- Stylus pressed (not drawn)
- Wedges
- Abstract (pictures become wedges)

**Rebus Principle:**
- Sound (phonetic)
- Symbol can represent sound, not just object
- Example: "bee" picture → sound /bi/
- Allows abstract concepts

**Syllabic:**
- Signs represent syllables
- Hundreds of signs

**Languages:**
- Sumerian (first)
- Akkadian, Hittite, Elamite, others (adapted)

**Content:**
- Administrative (majority)
- Royal inscriptions
- Literature (*Epic of Gilgamesh*)
- Laws (*Code of Hammurabi*)
- Letters, contracts, omens

**Decipherment:**
- Behistun Inscription (Iran)
- Georg Friedrich Grotefend, Henry Rawlinson (19th C)
- Trilingual (Old Persian, Elamite, Akkadian)
- Persian deciphered first → key to others

---

## Egyptian Hieroglyphics

### Sacred Writing

**Origin:**
- ~3,200 BCE
- Slightly after Mesopotamia (influenced? or independent?)

**Types:**

**Hieroglyphics ("Sacred Carving"):**
- Formal, monumental
- Stone inscriptions
- Temples, tombs

**Hieratic:**
- Cursive form
- Ink on papyrus
- Everyday use

**Demotic:**
- Later, even more cursive
- Ptolemaic, Roman periods

**System:**
- Mix: logographic + phonetic
- Pictographic origins
- Consonants (no vowels written)
- Determinatives (clarify meaning)

**Content:**
- Royal propaganda
- Religious texts (*Book of the Dead*)
- Funerary (tombs)
- Administrative

**Decipherment:**

**Rosetta Stone (196 BCE):**
- Discovered 1799 (Napoleon's expedition, Egypt)
- Trilingual: Hieroglyphic, Demotic, Greek
- Greek known → key

**Jean-François Champollion (1822):**
- French scholar
- Broke code
- Realized phonetic, not just pictographic
- Cartouches (royal names) Ptolemy, Cleopatra

---

## Chinese Writing

### Oracle Bones and Beyond

**Origin:**
- ~1,200 BCE (Shang dynasty, oracle bones)
- Possibly earlier (disputed)

**Oracle Bones:**
- Divination
- Questions inscribed
- Heat applied (cracks interpreted)
- Turtle shells, ox scapulae
- Anyang site

**System:**
- Logographic
- Thousands of characters
- Each character = word/morpheme
- Evolved from pictographs

**Continuity:**
- Still used today (modified)
- Longest continuous writing tradition

**Content:**
- Divination (early)
- Royal records
- Literature, philosophy
- Confucius, Laozi, etc.

**No Decipherment:**
- Continuous tradition (never lost)

---

## Mesoamerican Writing

### Maya Glyphs

**Origin:**
- Zapotec/Olmec (~900-600 BCE, early)
- Maya (~250 BCE onwards, develops)

**Maya Script:**
- Logosyllabic
- ~800 signs
- Mix: logograms + syllables
- Complex

**Content:**
- Royal history (stelae, monuments)
- Calendars (Long Count)
- Ritual, astronomy
- Codices (books, bark paper)
  - Only 4 survive (Spanish burned most)

**Decipherment:**

**Yuri Knorozov (1950s):**
- Russian linguist
- Recognized phonetic (not just pictographic)
- Breakthrough

**Linda Schele, David Stuart, others:**
- 1970s onwards
- Deciphered much
- Maya history revealed
- Warfare, dynastic struggles

**Impact:**
- Transformed Maya studies
- From "peaceful" to warlike
- Individual kings, queens named

---

## Indus Script

### Still Undeciphered

**Seals:**
- ~2,600-1,900 BCE
- Short inscriptions (5-7 signs)
- Animals (bull, unicorn)
- Trade, administration?

**Is It Writing?**
- Debated
- Too short for full decipherment
- Symbols or script?

**Challenges:**
- Harappan language unknown
- No bilingual texts
- Collapse → discontinuity

**Attempts:**
- Many claims (none accepted)
- Dravidian? Indo-European?

---

## Khipu: Not Writing

### Inka Record-Keeping

**What Is It?**
- Knotted strings
- Cotton or wool
- Colors, knots, position encode information

**Function:**
- Accounting (primary)
- Census, tribute, inventories
- Possibly narrative?

**Quipucamayocs:**
- Specialists (read/create)
- Elite knowledge

**Is It Writing?**
- Technically no (not linguistic)
- But: complex information storage
- "Writing" narrowly defined

**Spanish Conquest:**
- Most destroyed
- ~600 survive
- Decipherment incomplete

**Gary Urton:**
- Studied khipu
- Possible binary code?

---

## What Writing Tells Us

### Insights from Texts

**Administration:**
- Taxation, tribute
- Resource management
- Ration lists (Mesopotamia)
- Population (census)

**Elite Perspective:**
- **Biased:** Rulers, priests write
- Commoners silent
- Propaganda

**Ideology:**
- Legitimation (divine kingship)
- Mythology
- Cosmology

**History:**
- Dynastic sequences
- Wars, conquests
- But: selective, idealized

**Daily Life (Sometimes):**
- Letters, contracts
- Lawsuits
- Prices, wages
- Marriage, divorce

**Examples:**

**Amarna Letters (Egypt, ~1,350 BCE):**
- Diplomatic correspondence
- Egypt ↔ Near East
- International relations

**Linear B (Mycenaean Greek, ~1,450-1,200 BCE):**
- Administrative (palaces)
- Inventories
- Prosaic (no literature)

**Maya Stelae:**
- Royal propaganda
- Warfare victories
- Rituals

---

## Literacy Rates

### Who Could Read?

**Ancient World:**
- **Very low literacy** (1-10%?)
- Elite, scribes
- Specialized knowledge
- Power monopoly

**Scribal Schools:**
- Training (years)
- Mesopotamia (edubba, "tablet house")
- Egypt
- China

**Gender:**
- Mostly male
- Exceptions (elite women)
- Egypt: some female scribes

---

## Decipherment Challenges

### How to Crack Codes

**Requirements:**

**Known Language:**
- If language survives, easier
- Linear B: Michael Ventris (1952)
  - Recognized Greek
  - Archaic form

**Bilingual Texts:**
- Rosetta Stone (hieroglyphics)
- Behistun (cuneiform)

**Context:**
- Archaeological
- Cultural knowledge

**Long Texts:**
- Statistical analysis
- Patterns

**Still Undeciphered:**
- **Indus script**
- **Linear A** (Minoan, Crete, ~1,800-1,450 BCE)
  - Related to Linear B but different language
- **Etruscan** (Italy, ~700-100 BCE)
  - Alphabet known (from Greek)
  - Language poorly understood
- **Rongorongo** (Easter Island)

---

## Collapse Theories

### Why Societies Fall

**Complexity:**
- States are complex
- Interconnected
- Fragile?

---

## Environmental Explanations

### Ecological Collapse

**Deforestation:**
- Soil erosion
- Decreased productivity
- Example: Maya (maybe)

**Climate Change:**
- Drought
- Crop failures
- Famine
- Example: Maya (Terminal Classic, ~800-900 CE)
  - Paleoclimate evidence (lake sediments)
  - Severe drought

**Overexploitation:**
- Resources depleted
- Unsustainable

**Examples:**
- **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):**
  - Jared Diamond: deforestation → collapse
  - Trees cut (moai transport?)
  - Critique: Terry Hunt, Carl Lipo
  - Rats ate seeds? European disease?
  - Debated

---

## Social and Political Explanations

### Internal Strife

**Inequality:**
- Elite exploitation
- Peasant revolt
- Instability

**Warfare:**
- Inter-state conflict
- Destruction
- Maya: constant warfare

**Loss of Legitimacy:**
- Ideology fails (drought, famine)
- Rulers can't deliver
- Collapse of authority

---

## Economic Explanations

### Trade Disruption

**Long-Distance Networks:**
- Elites depend on exotics
- Routes disrupted (war, climate)
- Collapse

**Example:**
- **Bronze Age Collapse (~1,200 BCE):**
  - Mediterranean, Near East
  - Multiple states fall (Mycenaeans, Hittites, etc.)
  - "Sea Peoples" (mysterious invaders?)
  - Trade network collapse
  - Systems failure

---

## Systems Complexity: Joseph Tainter

### *The Collapse of Complex Societies* (1988)

**Argument:**
- Complexity has costs (administration, military, etc.)
- Benefits initially high (diminishing returns over time)
- Eventually: costs > benefits
- Collapse = simplification (rational response)
- Not "failure," adaptation

**Investments:**
- Agriculture (irrigation, terracing)
- Military (standing armies)
- Bureaucracy
- Information processing

**Marginal Returns Decline:**
- First investments: high return
- Later: less effective
- Example: agriculture
  - Best land first (high yield)
  - Marginal land later (low yield, more effort)

**Unsustainable:**
- People opt out
- State can't maintain
- Collapses to simpler

**Examples:**
- Roman Empire (West)
- Maya

**Critique:**
- Rational choice (always?)
- Doesn't explain why some survive
- Multivariate needed

---

## Multivariate Models

### Cascading Failures

**Most Accepted:**
- No single cause
- Multiple stressors
- Feedback loops
- Collapse = systemic failure

**Example: Maya Collapse**

**Factors:**
- Drought (climate)
- Overpopulation (stress resources)
- Warfare (constant, destructive)
- Deforestation (environmental)
- Trade disruption (economic)
- Loss of legitimacy (social/ideological)

**Not End:**
- Maya continue (northern cities)
- Population survives
- Reorganization
- Spanish conquest (1500s) separate

---

## Resilience and Continuity

### Not All Collapse

**Some Adapt:**
- Climate change → migration
- Trade disruption → local production
- Political collapse → new polities

**Resilience Factors:**
- Diversity (economy, crops)
- Flexibility (social, political)
- Cooperation
- Knowledge

**Example:**
- **Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi):**
  - Chaco Canyon collapse (~1150 CE)
  - Drought
  - But: descendants continue (Hopi, Zuni, others)
  - Reorganization, migration

---

## Lessons for Today?

### Relevance

**Jared Diamond:**
- *Collapse* (2005)
- Warnings (environmental destruction)
- Easter Island, Maya = cautionary tales

**Critique:**
- Simplistic?
- Environmental determinism
- Ignores resilience, agency
- But: environmental limits real

**Debate:**
- Can we learn from past collapses?
- Modern world different (global, technology)
- Or: fundamentally similar (finite resources)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is writing essential for civilization?

**Question 2:** Why did the Indus script never get deciphered?

**Question 3:** Is collapse inevitable for complex societies?

**Question 4:** What can modern societies learn from ancient collapses?

**Question 5:** Did the Maya really "collapse" or just reorganize?
