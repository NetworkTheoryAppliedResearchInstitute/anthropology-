# Applied Anthropology: Knowledge in Action

---

## Beyond the Ivory Tower

For decades, "applied anthropology" was looked down upon in the discipline. "Real" anthropologists did pure research, advancing theory. Applied work—using anthropology to solve practical problems—was seen as less rigorous, less intellectual, maybe even selling out.

That's changed dramatically. Today, more anthropologists work outside academia than within it. They're employed by:
- Corporations (tech companies, marketing firms, financial institutions)
- NGOs and international development organizations
- Government agencies (CDC, USAID, military, intelligence)
- Healthcare systems
- Museums and cultural heritage organizations
- Environmental organizations
- Communities and tribal governments

Applied anthropology isn't just a career path—it's a philosophical position: **anthropological knowledge should be useful.**

## What is Applied Anthropology?

**Applied anthropology** is the use of anthropological knowledge, theory, and methods to solve practical human problems.

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Problem-Driven:** Starts with real-world issues, not just theoretical questions
2. **Client or Community-Focused:** Serves stakeholders beyond academia
3. **Action-Oriented:** Aims for concrete outcomes, not just publications
4. **Interdisciplinary:** Often works with other professionals
5. **Time-Sensitive:** Operates on real-world timelines, not academic schedules
6. **Accountable:** Results matter to people affected

**But:** Applied anthropology still requires rigorous methods, theoretical grounding, and ethical practice—it's not "anthropology lite."

## Historical Development

### Early Applied Work: Compromised Beginnings

Applied anthropology has a troubled history:

> **Colonial Administration:**
> British anthropologists in Africa provided knowledge to colonial governments about "native" systems—how to govern through tribal structures, how to extract labor, how to prevent resistance.

> **World War II:**
> American anthropologists worked for the military—studying Japanese culture to understand the enemy, analyzing Micronesian societies for occupation planning. Ruth Benedict's *The Chrysanthemum and the Sword* (1946) analyzed Japanese culture for the U.S. government.

> **Development Projects:**
> Early development anthropology often served Cold War interests, implementing modernization programs that disrupted traditional societies.

**The Problem:** Applied work served power rather than the communities being studied.

### Ethical Awakening: The Vietnam Era

**The Camelot Affair (1965):**
The U.S. military funded Project Camelot to study conditions leading to revolution in Latin America—essentially counterinsurgency research. When exposed, the anthropological community was outraged.

**Result:**
- AAA established ethical codes
- Applied work became suspect
- Debate about anthropology's political obligations

### Contemporary Applied Anthropology: Community-Centered

Modern applied anthropology increasingly:
- Works FOR communities, not just ABOUT them
- Emphasizes participatory and collaborative approaches
- Prioritizes community benefit
- Questions who defines "problems" and "solutions"
- Recognizes power dynamics in applied work

## Applied Anthropology Across the Four Fields

### 1. Applied Cultural Anthropology

**Corporate Anthropology:**

> **Example: Intel's "People and Practices" Research**
>
> Intel employs anthropologists to study how people actually use technology in their homes and workplaces. Researchers conduct ethnographic fieldwork—observing families, workers, students—to understand:
> - What problems do people face that technology could address?
> - How do people adapt technologies in unexpected ways?
> - What cultural factors affect technology adoption?
>
> **Impact:** Product design, marketing strategies, innovation priorities based on real human needs and practices, not just engineering possibilities.

**International Development:**

> **Example: Participatory Irrigation Management (Nepal)**
>
> Development agencies wanted to improve irrigation in Nepal. Instead of imposing Western engineering solutions, anthropologists studied:
> - Existing indigenous irrigation systems (very sophisticated)
> - Local knowledge and management practices
> - Social organization around water
> - Why previous projects failed
>
> **Result:** Programs that worked WITH local systems rather than replacing them, leading to better outcomes and sustainability.

**Public Health:**

> **Example: Guinea Worm Eradication**
>
> Medical anthropologists worked on Guinea worm eradication in West Africa. Success required understanding:
> - Local water use practices
> - Cultural beliefs about disease
> - Social organization for behavior change
> - Effective communication strategies
>
> **Impact:** Guinea worm nearly eradicated (from 3.5 million cases in 1986 to <20 in 2023), largely because programs incorporated anthropological insights.

**Other Cultural Applications:**
- User Experience (UX) research for tech companies
- Immigration and refugee services
- Educational program design
- Community development
- Cultural competency training
- Social impact assessment

### 2. Applied Biological Anthropology

**Forensic Anthropology:**

> **Example: Identifying Disaster Victims**
>
> After 9/11, the Asian tsunami, earthquakes, plane crashes—forensic anthropologists help identify human remains through:
> - Skeletal analysis
> - Age, sex, stature estimation
> - Trauma analysis
> - DNA extraction and analysis
> - Working with families
>
> **Impact:** Closure for families, evidence for investigations, humanitarian service.

**Public Health and Nutrition:**

> **Example: Childhood Malnutrition Programs**
>
> Biological anthropologists measure child growth, assess nutritional status, and analyze health outcomes to:
> - Identify at-risk populations
> - Evaluate intervention effectiveness
> - Understand biological impacts of poverty
> - Design culturally appropriate nutrition programs

**Evolutionary Medicine:**

> **Example: Understanding Antibiotic Resistance**
>
> Evolutionary biologists and anthropologists study bacterial evolution, showing:
> - How antibiotic overuse accelerates resistance
> - Why this is an evolutionary arms race
> - How to slow resistance emergence
>
> **Impact:** Public health policy, medical practice guidelines, patient education.

**Other Biological Applications:**
- Ergonomics and workplace design
- Sports performance and injury prevention
- Aging and gerontology programs
- Occupational health and safety
- Bioethics consulting
- Primate conservation

### 3. Applied Archaeology

**Cultural Resource Management (CRM):**

> **Example: Highway Construction Project**
>
> Before building a highway, federal law requires archaeological survey:
> - Survey identifies potential sites
> - Excavate sites that will be destroyed
> - Document findings
> - Consult with indigenous communities
> - Preserve significant sites or mitigate impacts
>
> **Impact:** Most archaeologists work in CRM—protecting cultural heritage while allowing development.

**Heritage Management:**

> **Example: Machu Picchu Conservation**
>
> Archaeologists work with Peruvian government and local communities to:
> - Study site deterioration (tourism impacts)
> - Develop sustainable tourism plans
> - Train local guides
> - Protect against looting
> - Balance preservation with economic needs

**Repatriation:**

> **Example: NAGPRA Implementation**
>
> Archaeologists work with Native American tribes to:
> - Identify tribal affiliation of remains and objects
> - Facilitate return of ancestors and sacred objects
- Document cultural patrimony
> - Respect indigenous knowledge about items
>
> **Impact:** Over 200,000 Native American remains and 1.7 million objects repatriated since 1990.

**Other Archaeological Applications:**
- Urban planning and development
- Environmental impact assessment
- Historic preservation
- Museum exhibit design
- Tourism development
- Underwater archaeology (shipwrecks, submerged sites)

### 4. Applied Linguistic Anthropology

**Language Documentation and Revitalization:**

> **Example: Wampanoag Language Reclamation**
>
> Wampanoag language (Massachusetts) had no living speakers. Linguistic anthropologist Jessie Little Doe Baird led revitalization:
> - Analyzed historical documents
> - Reconstructed grammar and vocabulary
> - Developed teaching materials
> - Trained teachers
> - Created immersion programs
>
> **Result:** New generation of Wampanoag speakers; language reclaimed after 150 years of dormancy.

**Healthcare Communication:**

> **Example: Doctor-Patient Discourse**
>
> Linguistic anthropologists analyze medical interactions to improve:
> - How doctors explain diagnoses
> - Patient understanding and compliance
> - Cross-cultural communication
> - Reducing health disparities
> - Training medical students

**Educational Linguistics:**

> **Example: Bilingual Education Programs**
>
> Linguistic anthropologists study:
> - How bilingual children actually learn
> - Cultural assumptions in education
> - Effective pedagogy for language learners
> - Assessment issues
>
> **Impact:** Better bilingual education programs, policy recommendations.

**Other Linguistic Applications:**
- Translation and interpretation services
- Language policy development
- Forensic linguistics (legal disputes, authorship)
- Workplace communication
- Technology and AI language systems

## Ethical Challenges in Applied Work

### Who Is the Client?

> **Dilemma:**
> You're hired by a corporation to study workers. You discover exploitative practices. Do you:
> - Report honestly to the corporation (risking workers' jobs)?
> - Advocate for workers (violating client confidentiality)?
> - Refuse to share findings that could harm workers?

**Principle:** Primary obligation is to people studied, not client or employer.

### Informed Consent in Applied Settings

- Can workers really refuse if boss supports research?
- Do communities understand how research will be used?
- What if client uses findings in harmful ways?

### Dual Use Knowledge

> **Example: Counterinsurgency Research**
>
> Human Terrain System (HTS) embedded anthropologists with U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan. Controversy:
> - Does anthropological knowledge help counterinsurgency?
> - Can anthropologists maintain neutrality in war zones?
> - Do communities understand military use of information?
>
> Most anthropological associations condemned HTS as unethical.

**Question:** Can any knowledge be purely neutral, or does all applied work involve political choices?

### Short-Term Projects vs. Long-Term Relationships

Applied work often requires quick turnaround. But:
- Deep understanding takes time
- Communities need sustained relationships
- Hit-and-run research is extractive

**Challenge:** Balancing client needs with ethical obligations.

- "Atheoretical"
- "Selling out"

**Of Academic Work:**
- "Irrelevant to real problems"
- "Extractive and exploitative"
- "Privileges theory over people"
- "Inaccessible and elitist"

### Finding Common Ground:

Many anthropologists argue for:
- **Engaged scholarship:** Rigorous AND useful
- **Public anthropology:** Making academic work accessible
- **Collaborative research:** Community partnerships
- **Applied theory:** Using theory to solve problems
- **Reciprocity:** Academic research should benefit communities

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Should all anthropology be applied, or is "pure" research valuable even without immediate practical application?

**Question 2:** If an anthropologist discovers something that could harm the community being studied, what should they do?

**Question 3:** Is working for corporations fundamentally compromised, or can anthropologists maintain ethics in corporate settings?

**Question 4:** How can applied anthropology avoid reproducing colonial extraction patterns?

**Question 5:** What new applied anthropology fields might emerge in the next 20 years?

**Remember:** Applied anthropology isn't a separate field—it's using anthropological knowledge to make a difference in the world. Whether you work in academia or outside it, the ultimate test of anthropology is whether it helps us understand and improve human life. Applied work keeps anthropology grounded, relevant, and accountable to the communities we study.
