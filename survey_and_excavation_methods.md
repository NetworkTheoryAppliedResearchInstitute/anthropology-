# Survey and Excavation Methods: Finding and Digging Sites

---

## Archaeological Survey

### Finding Sites

**Purpose:**
- Locate sites
- Map distributions
- Sample regions
- Minimal disturbance

**Types:**

### Reconnaissance Survey

**Unsystematic:**
- Walk around
- Talk to locals
- Look for surface artifacts
- Quick, preliminary

**Limitations:**
- Biased (visible, accessible sites)
- Not representative

### Systematic Survey

**Planned Coverage:**
- Transects (lines across landscape)
- Grid (systematic spacing)
- Total coverage (if small area)

**Methods:**
- Pedestrian (walk, look)
- Shovel test pits (small holes, check subsurface)
- Augering (core sampling)

**Recording:**
- GPS locations
- Artifact densities
- Site boundaries
- Environmental context

**Examples:**
- Gordon Willey (Peru, 1950s): settlement patterns
- Great Basin surveys (USA)

### Remote Sensing

**Non-Invasive Technology:**

**Aerial Photography:**
- From planes, drones
- Crop marks (differential growth over buried features)
- Shadow marks (earthworks)
- Soil marks (color differences)

**Satellite Imagery:**
- Large scale
- Multi-spectral
- Track deforestation, looting

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):**
- Laser pulses
- Penetrates forest canopy
- Reveals hidden structures
- **Revolutionary for Maya archaeology**
  - Tikal, Calakmul: massive cities
  - Previously unknown features

**Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR):**
- Electromagnetic pulses
- Subsurface features
- Non-destructive
- Burials, walls, voids

**Magnetometry:**
- Magnetic field variations
- Hearths, kilns, pits (burned, high magnetism)
- Iron objects

**Resistivity:**
- Electrical resistance
- Stone (high), pits/ditches (low)
- Walls, foundations

**Advantages:**
- Non-destructive
- Large areas quickly
- See buried features

**Limitations:**
- Expensive
- Interpretation complex
- Ground-truthing needed (excavate to verify)

---

## Excavation

### Controlled Destruction

**Fundamental Principle:**
- Excavation destroys
- Unrepeatable
- Must record meticulously

**When to Excavate:**
- Research questions
- Cultural Resource Management (CRM, development threat)
- Training

**Ethical:**
- Don't excavate unless necessary
- Preserve for future (better techniques)

---

## Stratigraphy

### The Law of Superposition

**Principle:**
- Deeper = older (usually)
- Layers (strata) accumulate over time
- Unless disturbed

**Nicholas Steno (17th C):**
- Geologist
- Superposition principle

**Archaeological Application:**
- Relative dating
- Sequence of occupations

**Stratigraphic Profile:**
- Side of excavation
- Shows layers
- Draw, photograph

**Features:**
- Pits, postholes cut through layers
- More recent than layers they cut
- Stratigraphy reveals sequence

---

## Harris Matrix

### Documenting Stratigraphy

**Edward Harris (1970s):**
- System for complex stratigraphy
- Diagram relationships
- "Earlier than," "later than," "contemporary with"

**Urban Sites:**
- Complex (many occupations)
- Pits, foundations, rebuilding
- Matrix essential

---

## Excavation Methods

### Different Approaches

### Arbitrary Levels

**Method:**
- Excavate in fixed depths (e.g., 10 cm)
- Grid (1x1 m or 2x2 m squares)
- Screen soil

**Pros:**
- Systematic
- Vertical control

**Cons:**
- Ignores natural stratigraphy
- May mix layers

**Common:**
- North America (early)
- Thick deposits (caves, shell middens)

### Natural Levels

**Method:**
- Follow layers
- Excavate one stratum at a time
- More interpretive

**Pros:**
- Respects stratigraphy
- Better contextual control

**Cons:**
- Requires skill (recognize layers)
- Slower

**Common:**
- European tradition
- Complex sites

### Open-Area Excavation

**Method:**
- Large horizontal exposures
- Remove layers sequentially
- See spatial relationships

**Advantages:**
- House floors, activity areas
- Patterns visible

**Common:**
- European rescue archaeology
- Large-scale (bulldozer stripping topsoil, then careful excavation)

## Recording

### Meticulous Documentation

**Why:**
- Excavation destroys
- Records are all that remain
- Future reanalysis depends on records

**What to Record:**

**Context:**
- Provenience (location: X, Y, Z coordinates)
- Stratum, feature
- Associations (what found together)

**Artifacts:**
- Type, material, condition
- Measurements
- Photos (in situ before removal)

**Features:**
- Dimensions, shape
- Fill (contents)
- Drawings (plan, profile)
- Photos

**Samples:**
- Soil (flotation for seeds, charcoal)
- Bone, shell
- Pollen
- Dating samples (charcoal, bone for radiocarbon)

**Methods:**

**Field Notes:**
- Daily log
- Observations, interpretations
- Weather, crew

**Forms:**
- Standardized (context sheets, feature forms)
- Ensures consistency

**Drawings:**
- Plans (overhead view)
- Profiles (vertical section)
- Scale (meter stick, north arrow)

**Photography:**
- Digital (many photos)
- Scale, ID tags
- Before, during, after excavation

**Total Station:**
- Electronic surveying
- Precise 3D coordinates
- Laser measurement

**GIS/3D Modeling:**
- Digital recording
- Photogrammetry (Structure from Motion)
- 3D site models

## Screening and Flotation

### Recovering Small Items

**Screening (Sieving):**
- Pass soil through mesh
- Recover small artifacts (beads, chips, bone fragments)
- Mesh size (1/4 inch common, 1/8 inch fine)

**Wet Screening:**
- Water helps separate
- Better for small items

**Flotation:**
- Water + soil
- Organic materials float (charcoal, seeds)
- Heavy fraction sinks (bone, lithics)
- Recover botanical remains
- Essential for diet studies

---

## Special Contexts

### Burials

**Ethical:**
- Sensitive (human remains)
- Descendant communities consult
- NAGPRA (US), similar laws

**Excavation:**
- Slow, careful
- In situ photography
- Position, orientation
- Skeletal elements recorded
- Grave goods associated

**Information:**
- Age, sex (bioarchaeology)
- Health, trauma
- Burial practices (social status, ideology)

**Reburial:**
- Often required (NAGPRA)
- After study

### Underwater Archaeology

**Challenges:**
- Visibility poor
- Time limits (diving)
- Expensive

**Methods:**
- Scuba, submersibles
- Grids, mapping underwater
- Airlift (underwater vacuum)

**Preservation:**
- Excellent (anaerobic)
- Organics survive

**Examples:**
- Shipwrecks (trade, technology)
- Submerged settlements (lake dwellings, sea-level rise)

### Urban Archaeology

**Challenges:**
- Deep deposits (many occupations)
- Modern construction
- Limited space
- Rescue (development threat)

**Methods:**
- Open-area (mechanical stripping)
- Fast (salvage)
- Deep trenches

**Examples:**
- London, Rome, Athens
- Continuous occupation (millennia)

---

## Cultural Resource Management (CRM)

### Archaeology and Development

**Laws:**
- National Historic Preservation Act (US, 1966)
- Similar laws worldwide
- Require surveys before development

**CRM Archaeology:**
- Most archaeologists employed here
- Compliance (legal requirements)
- Time pressure
- Not always research-driven

**Process:**
1. Survey (find sites)
2. Assessment (significance)
3. Mitigation (excavation if necessary, or avoid)
4. Report

**Pros:**
- Saves sites
- Funds archaeology
- Large data sets

**Cons:**
- Rushed
- Developer priorities
- Data not always published

---

## Sampling

### You Can't Dig Everything

**Strategies:**

**Probabilistic:**
- Random sampling
- Stratified random (divide region, sample each)
- Systematic (every Nth unit)
- Statistical inference

**Judgmental:**
- Based on knowledge
- Target specific site types
- Biased but efficient

**Practical:**
- Access (permission, terrain)
- Budgets
- Time

**Debate:**
- Total excavation ideal (never practical)
- Sample representative?
- Bias acknowledged

---

## Ethics

### Responsible Archaeology

**Principles:**

**Stewardship:**
- Preserve for future
- Don't excavate unnecessarily
- Curate collections

**Descendant Communities:**
- Consult, collaborate
- Respect wishes (repatriation, site protection)

**Avoid Looting:**
- Don't buy antiquities (fuels market)
- Report looting
- UNESCO conventions

**Publication:**
- Disseminate findings
- Open access
- Make data available

**Public Outreach:**
- Education
- Involve communities
- Counter pseudoarchaeology

**Professional Standards:**
- Register of Professional Archaeologists (RPA)
- Codes of ethics (SAA, etc.)

---

## Experimental Archaeology

### Learning by Doing

**Purpose:**
- Test hypotheses
- Understand processes
- Reverse-engineer

**Examples:**

**Stone Tool Replication:**
- Don Crabtree, François Bordes
- Learn techniques
- Use-wear studies

**Pottery:**
- Firing temperatures
- Construction methods
- Use, breakage

**Buildings:**
- Reconstruction (experimental farms)
- Labor estimates
- Techniques

**Butchery:**
- Cut marks on bone
- Tool efficiency

**Smelting:**
- Metallurgy (recreate furnaces)
- Temperatures, ores

**Navigation:**
- Replicate boats (Polynesian voyaging canoes)
- Test feasibility (Kon-Tiki, Heyerdahl)

---

## Ethnoarchaeology

### Watching People Now

**Method:**
- Study living peoples
- Document material correlates of behavior

**Purpose:**
- Generate hypotheses
- Test assumptions
- Understand variability

**Examples:**

**Lewis Binford (Nunamiut):**
- Bone assemblages (hunting, butchery, dogs)
- Actualistic studies

**Carol Kramer (Iran):**
- Pottery (use, discard, recycling)

**!Kung (Kalahari):**
- Richard Lee, John Yellen
- Hunter-gatherer sites (formation, structure)

**Cautions:**
- Not "living fossils"
- Cultural variation
- Analogy, not identity

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is excavation ethical if it destroys the site?

**Question 2:** Should all archaeology be collaborative with descendant communities?

**Question 3:** Can remote sensing replace excavation?

**Question 4:** Is CRM archaeology "real" archaeology or just salvage?

**Question 5:** How representative are our samples of the past?

**Remember:** Archaeological survey finds sites—reconnaissance unsystematic, systematic planned (transects/grids/total coverage), remote sensing non-invasive (aerial photography crop marks, LiDAR revolutionary Maya penetrates canopy, GPR subsurface, magnetometry/resistivity). Excavation controlled destruction unrepeatable—meticulous recording essential. Stratigraphy Law of Superposition (deeper=older usually), Harris Matrix diagrams complex relationships. Methods: arbitrary levels (fixed depths systematic), natural levels (follow strata respects context), open-area (horizontal exposures spatial patterns). Recording: context/provenience (3D coordinates), artifacts/features (photos/drawings/measurements), samples (flotation seeds/charcoal botanical diet), total station/GIS/3D modeling. Screening/flotation recover small items. Special contexts: burials (ethical NAGPRA consultation), underwater (excellent preservation shipwrecks), urban (deep complex rescue). CRM archaeology development compliance (most archaeologists employed, saves sites but rushed). Sampling probabilistic/judgmental/practical (can't dig everything). Ethics: stewardship, descendant communities, avoid looting, publication, outreach. Experimental archaeology learn by doing (stone tools Crabtree/Bordes, pottery firing, building reconstruction). Ethnoarchaeology observe living peoples material correlates (Binford Nunamiut bones, Kramer pottery, Lee !Kung not "living fossils"). Understanding survey/excavation methods reveals careful systematic destructive process—preservation priority, context crucial, detailed recording permanent record.
