# Middle East: Conflict, Displacement, and Refugees

---

## Orientalism and Representation

### Edward Said's Critique

**Edward Said:**
- Palestinian-American literary critic, public intellectual
- *Orientalism* (1978)
  - Foundational postcolonial text
  - Anthropology significantly influenced

**Argument:**
- "Orient" = Western construct (imagined, not real)
- Orientalism = discourse (power/knowledge, Foucault)
- Represents Middle East/Asia as:
  - Exotic, mysterious, backward, sensual, despotic
  - Opposite of "Occident" (rational, progressive, democratic West)
- **Function:** Justify colonialism, imperialism
  - "Civilizing mission"
  - Orientals need Western guidance

**Impact on Anthropology:**
- Self-critique (anthropology complicit?)
- Representation politics (how to write about others?)
- Positionality (researcher power, reflexivity)

**Critiques of Said:**
- Overgeneralized (all Western scholarship = Orientalist?)
- Ignored indigenous agency (voices, scholars)
- Homogenized "the West"

**Contemporary Relevance:**
- Media representations (Middle East as violent, oppressed)
- "War on Terror" discourse (civilizational clash narratives)
- Muslim women "rescue" narratives (Abu-Lughod critique)

## Sectarianism: Sunni-Shia Divide

### Historical Split

**Origins:**
- 7th C CE (death of Prophet Muhammad, 632)
- Succession dispute:
  - **Sunni:** Caliphs elected (community consensus, Abu Bakr first)
  - **Shia:** Ali (Prophet's cousin, son-in-law) rightful successor
- Battle of Karbala (680): Hussein (Ali's son) killed by Umayyads
  - Martyrdom (central Shia identity)
  - Ashura (commemoration, annual mourning)

**Theological Differences:**
- Sunni: Four schools of law (*madhhab*)
- Shia: Imams (divinely guided leaders, descendants of Ali)
  - Twelver Shia (largest, Iran, Iraq): 12 Imams, 12th hidden
  - Ismaili, Zaydi (smaller branches)
- Practices: Differences in prayer, pilgrimage, jurisprudence

**Demographics:**
- Sunni: ~85-90% Muslims worldwide
- Shia: ~10-15% Muslims worldwide
- Concentrations: Iran (90% Shia), Iraq (60-65% Shia), Bahrain (60-70% Shia), Lebanon (significant), Yemen (significant Zaydi)

---

## Sectarian Politics

### Modern Conflicts

**NOT Primordial:**
- Sectarianism = politically mobilized (not ancient hatreds)
- Colonial legacy (divide and rule)
- Modern states (sectarian identities hardened)

**Iran-Saudi Rivalry:**
- Iran: Shia theocracy (1979 revolution)
- Saudi Arabia: Sunni Wahhabi kingdom
- Regional competition (proxy wars)
  - Yemen (Saudi supports government, Iran supports Houthis)
  - Syria (Iran supports Assad, Saudi supports rebels)
  - Lebanon (Iran supports Hezbollah)
  - Bahrain (Sunni monarchy, Shia majority, 2011 uprising crushed with Saudi help)

**Iraq:**
- Sunni minority ruled (Ottoman, British, Saddam Hussein)
- Shia majority (marginalized)
- 2003 US invasion: Shia empowered (elections)
- Sectarian violence (2006-2008 civil war, Sunni insurgency, Shia militias)
- ISIS (2014+): Sunni extremist, anti-Shia

**Anthropology:**
- **Lara Deeb:** *An Enchanted Modern* (2006)
  - Shia Islamist women (Beirut)
  - Piety, modernity, politics
- **Toby Matthiesen:** Saudi Shia (Eastern Province, marginalized)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is Orientalism still relevant or outdated?

**Question 2:** Is sectarianism ancient or modern political construct?

**Question 3:** Can Palestinian-Israeli conflict be resolved? How?

**Question 4:** Were Arab Spring uprisings failures or ongoing processes?

**Question 5:** What are the long-term effects of mass displacement (Syria, Iraq, Yemen)?
