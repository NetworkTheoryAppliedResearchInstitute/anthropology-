# Race: Social Construction vs. Biological Reality

---

## The Central Point

**Race is NOT a valid biological concept.**
- Socially real, culturally powerful
- But: no biological basis
- Human variation exists
- But: doesn't divide into discrete "races"

**This is scientific consensus.**

---

## Why Race Isn't Biological

### 1. More Variation Within Than Between "Races"

**Richard Lewontin (1972):**
- Analyzed genetic variation
- **85% of variation within populations**
- **15% between populations**
- "Races" don't explain most variation

**Implication:**
- Two people from same "race" can be more genetically different than people from different "races"
- Race is poor predictor of genetics

**Critique of Lewontin:**
- A.W.F. Edwards (2003)
- With many genes, can cluster populations
- But: doesn't validate race
- Geographic ancestry ≠ race

### 2. Clinal Variation (Gradients)

**Clines:**
- Gradual change across geography
- No sharp boundaries
- Skin color: gradient from equator to poles
- Not discrete categories

**Example:**
- Northern Europe → Mediterranean → North Africa → Sub-Saharan Africa
- Continuous gradation
- Where to draw line?
- Arbitrary!

**Frank Livingstone (1962):**
- "There are no races, there are only clines"

### 3. Arbitrary and Inconsistent Categories

**"Races" Defined Differently:**
- US: "one-drop rule" (any African ancestry = Black)
- Brazil: dozens of categories, continuous
- South Africa: three main groups under apartheid
- Inconsistent globally

**Traits Don't Correlate:**
- Skin color + hair type + blood type don't cluster
- Independent traits
- Can't define consistent "races"

### 4. Recent Origin

**Human Genetic Diversity is LOW:**
- Compared to other species
- All humans recent African origin (~70,000 years ago)
- Little time for divergence

**Skin Color:**
- Evolved rapidly (last 100,000 years)
- Recent adaptation
- Superficial

## History of Race Concept

### Scientific Racism

**18th-19th Century:**
- Linnaeus (1735): classified humans into varieties
- Blumenbach (1795): five races (Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian, American, Malayan)
- Used to justify slavery, colonialism
- Hierarchy: Europeans superior

**19th Century "Science":**
- **Craniometry**: measuring skulls
- Samuel Morton, Paul Broca
- Claimed brain size differences
- Used to "prove" racial hierarchy
- **Flawed, biased** (Stephen Jay Gould exposed)

**Social Darwinism:**
- Misapplied evolution
- "Inferior" races
- Justified oppression
- Not real science

**Eugenics:**
- Francis Galton (Darwin's cousin)
- "Improve" human stock
- Forced sterilization
- Immigration restrictions
- Nazi genocide
- Dark legacy

### Franz Boas: Fighting Racism

**Boas (early 20th century):**
- Founder of American anthropology
- Fought scientific racism
- Showed:
  - Head shape changes with environment (immigrant study)
  - Race not fixed
  - Culture, not race, explains differences

**Influence:**
- Students (Mead, Benedict) spread anti-racist views
- UNESCO statements (1950s) rejecting race

## What IS Race, Then?

### Social Construction

**Race is:**
- Social category
- Culturally defined
- Historically contingent
- Real in consequences
- Not biological

**W.E.B. Du Bois:**
- Race = "sociohistorical concept"
- Product of racism
- Not biological reality

**Michael Omi & Howard Winant:**
- "Racial Formation"
- Race created through social processes
- Changes over time

---

## Ethnicity vs. Race

### Related but Distinct

**Ethnicity:**
- Cultural identity
- Language, religion, customs
- Self-identified
- Multiple, flexible

**Race:**
- Imposed category
- Based on appearance
- Hierarchical
- Used to oppress

**Overlap:**
- Sometimes conflated
- But: distinct concepts

---

## Why It Matters

### Real-World Consequences

**Health Disparities:**
- NOT genetic
- Social determinants:
  - Poverty
  - Discrimination
  - Environmental racism
  - Healthcare access

**Criminal Justice:**
- Racial profiling
- Mass incarceration
- Systemic racism

**Economics:**
- Wealth gap
- Employment discrimination
- Residential segregation

**Education:**
- School funding
- Achievement gaps
- Structural inequality

**Dorothy Roberts:**
- "Fatal Invention"
- Race in medicine
- BiDil (heart drug marketed to Black people)
- Reinforces race as biological

---

## Ancestry vs. Race

### Geographic Ancestry is Real

**Genetic Ancestry:**
- Can identify geographic origins
- Continental ancestry
- NOT same as race

**23andMe, etc.:**
- Ancestry DNA tests
- Show geographic origins
- But: misleading about "race"
- Percentages arbitrary
- Social construction reinforced

**Deborah Bolnick:**
- Genetic ancestry tests
- Limitations
- Not biological race

---

## Human Variation DOES Exist

### But Doesn't Support Races

**We Vary:**
- Skin color
- Hair texture
- Body form
- Disease susceptibility
- Lactose tolerance
- Altitude adaptation

**But:**
- Variation doesn't cluster into "races"
- Continuous, not discrete
- Recent, superficial
- Adaptive

**See:**
- [[adaptation.md]]
- [[genetic_diversity.md]]

---

## Genomics and Race

### Precision Medicine Debates

**Argument For:**
- Genetic differences affect drug response
- Disease risk
- Personalized medicine

**Argument Against:**
- "Race" too crude
- Individual variation more important
- Geographic ancestry better
- Reinforces race as biological

**Cautious Approach:**
- Use ancestry, not race
- Recognize social factors
- Avoid reifying race

---

## Biological vs. Social

### Both Real, Different Ways

**Biological Variation:**
- Exists
- Continuous
- Clinal
- Recent
- Adaptive

**Social Race:**
- Exists
- Powerful
- Shapes lives
- Hierarchical
- Oppressive

**NOT Same Thing:**
- Don't conflate
- Race is social, not biological

---

## Teaching About Race

### Challenges

**Misunderstandings:**
- "Colorblind" (ignores racism)
- "We're all the same" (ignores variation)
- "Race is just genetics" (no!)

**Better Framing:**
- Race is social construct
- Human variation exists (doesn't support race)
- Racism is real (affects health, life)
- Anti-racist science

**Alan Goodman:**
- "Race: Are We So Different?"
- Public education

**Jonathan Marks:**
- "Is Science Racist?"
- How science has been misused

---

## Contemporary Genetics and Race

### Ancient DNA

**Reveals:**
- Human history
- Migrations
- Admixture

**Dangers:**
- Can be misused
- White nationalism
- "Genetic purity" myths

**Responsible Science:**
- David Reich: "Who We Are and How We Got Here"
- Acknowledges complexity
- Warns against misuse
- No pure populations
- All mixed

---

## Sickle Cell Example

### Often Misunderstood

**Sickle Cell Anemia:**
- Genetic disorder
- Often called "Black disease"
- **WRONG**

**Reality:**
- Found where malaria was/is endemic
- Mediterranean, Middle East, India, Africa
- Not "racial"
- Environmental adaptation

**Heterozygote Advantage:**
- One sickle cell gene = malaria resistance
- Two genes = sickle cell disease
- Balanced polymorphism

**Lesson:**
- Disease tied to geography/history
- Not race

---

## Police Use of Race

### Forensic Anthropology Debates

**"Racial" ID from Skeletons:**
- Forensic anthropologists estimate "race"
- For police ID
- Based on skull measurements

**Problems:**
- Reinforces race as biological
- Error-prone
- Social category, not biological
- Better: ancestry estimation

**Reforms:**
- Move away from "race"
- Use ancestry
- Acknowledge limitations

---

## Moving Forward

### Anti-Racist Science

**What Scientists Should Do:**
- Reject race as biological
- Study human variation properly
- Address health disparities (social causes)
- Communicate clearly to public
- Combat scientific racism

**What Anthropology Has Done:**
- Leading anti-racist science since Boas
- American Anthropological Association statements
- Public education
- "RACE: Are We So Different?" exhibit

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** If race isn't biological, why do we still use it?

**Question 2:** Can we study health disparities without reinforcing race as biological?

**Question 3:** Should we be "colorblind" or acknowledge race?

**Question 4:** How do we explain human variation without validating race?

**Question 5:** What's your own racial identity, and how has it shaped your life?

**Remember:** Race is NOT a valid biological concept—this is scientific consensus. Evidence: (1) More variation within than between "races" (Lewontin 85/15), (2) Clinal variation (gradients, no boundaries), (3) Arbitrary inconsistent categories, (4) Recent origin (little genetic divergence). History: 18th-19th century scientific racism justified slavery/colonialism, eugenics led to forced sterilization/genocide. Boas fought racism. Race is social construction with real consequences (health disparities, criminal justice, wealth gap) but social not biological. Geographic ancestry ≠ race. Human variation exists but doesn't cluster into discrete races—continuous, clinal, adaptive. Genomics/precision medicine debates—use ancestry not race. Sickle cell tied to malaria geography not race. Forensic anthropology should move away from "race." Anthropology has led anti-racist science. Understanding race critique reveals biology doesn't support racial categories—racism creates race, not nature.
