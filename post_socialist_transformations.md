# Post-Socialist Transformations: Eastern Europe After 1989

---

## The Fall of Communism

### 1989-1991

**Timeline:**
- 1989: Berlin Wall falls (November 9)
- 1989: Velvet Revolution (Czechoslovakia, peaceful)
- 1989: Romanian Revolution (violent, Ceaușescu executed)
- 1990: German reunification
- 1991: Soviet Union dissolves (December 26)

**Causes:**
- Economic stagnation (planned economies inefficient)
- Political repression (loss of legitimacy)
- Gorbachev reforms (glasnost, perestroika, weakened control)
- Popular movements (Solidarity Poland, civic forum Czechoslovakia)
- Nationalism (republics sought independence)

---

## Economic Transformations

### Shock Therapy

**Definition:**
- Rapid transition (socialism → capitalism)
- "Big bang" approach (immediate, not gradual)
- Advocated by Western economists (Jeffrey Sachs, others)

**Key Policies:**
- **Liberalization:** Remove price controls
- **Privatization:** Sell state-owned enterprises
- **Stabilization:** Reduce inflation, balance budgets
- **Deregulation:** Free markets

**Poland (1990):**
- First shock therapy (Balcerowicz Plan)
- Immediate price liberalization
- Hyperinflation → stabilization
- Unemployment rose
- GDP fell initially (then recovered)

**Russia (1990s):**
- Chaotic privatization
- **Oligarchs:** Insiders bought state assets cheaply
- Yeltsin era (1991-1999): Economic collapse
- GDP declined ~40% (1990s)
- Life expectancy declined (unprecedented peacetime)
- **"Loans for shares" (1995):** Banks loaned government, received shares in companies
  - Created oligarchs (Khodorkovsky, Abramovich, others)

**Outcomes:**
- Winners: Elites, educated urbanites (some)
- Losers: Workers, pensioners, rural populations
- Inequality exploded (Gini coefficient rose dramatically)
- Social safety net collapsed

### Theorizing Socialism

**What Was Socialism, and What Comes Next?** (1996):
- Influential collection (essays)

**Key Arguments:**

**Socialism ≠ Capitalism's Opposite:**
- Both modern projects
- Similarities (bureaucracy, technology, development)
- Differences (property, planning vs. market)

**Paternalist State:**
- State = provider (jobs, housing, healthcare, childcare)
- Citizens = clients, children (dependent)
- Shortage economy (always shortages, hoarding, networks)

**Time:**
- Socialist time: Patience, waiting, queues
- Capitalist time: Speed, efficiency, time = money

**Property:**
- Socialist property: Ambiguous (state, collective, personal)
- Privatization: Who owns? (restitution debates, uncertainty)

**Post-Socialist Transformation:**
- Not simply "transition" (implies endpoint known)
- Messy, contested, multiple trajectories

---

## Nostalgia

### Ostalgie and Yugo-Nostalgia

**Ostalgie:**
- German: "Ost" (East) + "Nostalgie" (nostalgia)
- Nostalgia for GDR (East Germany)

**Why Nostalgia?**
- Disappointment with capitalism (unemployment, inequality, insecurity)
- Loss of community, solidarity
- Sense of security (jobs guaranteed, housing, healthcare)
- Simplicity (fewer choices, but less anxiety)

**What's Remembered:**
- Positive: Full employment, affordable housing, childcare, stability
- Forgotten/Minimized: Stasi surveillance, lack of freedom, travel restrictions, consumer goods shortages

**Selective Memory:**
- Not wanting communism back (majority)
- But dissatisfied with capitalism's outcomes

**Yugo-Nostalgia:**
- Yugoslavia nostalgia (former Yugoslavia states)
- Tito era (1945-1980) remembered fondly
- Coexistence (before ethnic wars)
- Economic security (better than post-war hardship)

**Anthropology:**

**Dominic Boyer:**
- *Spirit and System* (2005)
  - East German journalists (post-reunification)
  - Ostalgie, professional identities

**Maria Todorova & Zsuzsa Gille (eds.):**
- *Post-Communist Nostalgia* (2010)
  - Multiple contexts, comparative

## Gender

### Retraditionalization

**Socialist Gender Policies:**
- Women's employment (encouraged, high rates)
- Childcare (state-provided)
- Abortion (legal, accessible, most countries)
- Maternity leave (generous)
- BUT: Double burden (work + domestic labor)
- Gender equality rhetoric ≠ reality (leadership male-dominated)

**Post-Socialist Changes:**
- Women's employment decreased (laid off first)
- Childcare reduced (privatized, expensive)
- Abortion restricted (some countries: Poland, Hungary debates)
- Domestic sphere re-emphasized ("return to family values")
- Gender roles traditionalized

**Anthropology:**

**Gail Kligman:**
- Romania, reproductive politics
- Ceaușescu's pronatalism (banned abortion, contraception, 1966-1989)
  - Forced births (demographic policy)
  - Maternal mortality rose
  - Orphanages overflowed
- Post-1989: Abortion legalized (first decree, new government)

**Susan Gal & Gail Kligman:**
- *The Politics of Gender After Socialism* (2000)
  - Comparative (Hungary, Poland, others)
  - Gendered citizenship

---

## Civil Society

### Building Democracy

**Challenges:**
- No prior democratic institutions (decades)
- Weak civic organizations
- Distrust of politics (legacy of repression)
- Clientelism, corruption

**NGOs:**
- Proliferation (1990s)
- Western-funded (often)
- Debates: Top-down? Authentic? (critiques of dependency)

**Anthropology:**

**Janine Wedel:**
- *Collision and Collusion* (1998) - see Europe file
  - Poland, aid, consultants
  - Networks ("flex nets"), corruption

**Kristen Ghodsee:**
- *The Left Side of History* (2015)
  - Bulgaria, socialism, post-socialism, feminism
  - Socialist women's organizations (dissolved, replaced by Western NGOs)

---

## Ethnicity and Nationalism

### Resurgence

**Why Nationalism Returned:**
- Suppressed under socialism (internationalism ideology)
- State collapse (legitimacy vacuum, nationalism fills)
- Economic insecurity (scapegoating minorities)
- Democratization (ethnic majorities dominate)

**Roma:**
- Scapegoated (unemployment, crime blamed on Roma)
- Violence (attacks, pogroms)
- Segregation (schools, housing)
- Migration to Western Europe (faced discrimination there too)

**Hungary:**
- Orbán government (2010+)
  - Illiberal democracy (self-described)
  - Anti-immigrant (2015+ rhetoric)
  - Nationalism, Christianity emphasized

**Poland:**
- PiS (Law and Justice, 2015+)
  - Conservative, nationalist
  - Abortion restricted further
  - Judicial independence undermined
  - LGBT "ideology" attacks

---

## Memory and the Past

### Dealing with History

**Decommunization:**
- Removing communist symbols (statues, street names)
- Lustration (banning former officials, collaborators)
- Debates: How far? Who decides? Forgive or punish?

**Memorialization:**
- Museums (House of Terror, Budapest; Museum of Communism, Prague)
- Memorials (victims of communism)
- Debates: Which history? (partisan)

**Anthropology:**

**Michael Lambek:**
- Memory, ethics, past (theoretical)

**Katherine Verdery:**
- *The Political Lives of Dead Bodies* (1999)
  - Exhumations, reburials (post-socialist Romania)
  - Bodies = political symbols (heroes reinterred, reinterpreted)

---

## Putin's Russia

### Authoritarian Turn

**1990s Chaos → 2000s Order:**
- Yeltsin (1991-1999): Weak state, oligarchs, Chechen wars
- Putin (2000+): Centralization, stability (at cost of freedom)

**Putinism:**
- Managed democracy (elections but controlled)
- Media control (state TV dominant, opposition marginalized)
- Nationalism (Great Russian chauvinism)
- Anti-Western (NATO expansion, color revolutions, 2014 Ukraine)

**Ukraine:**
- 2014: Euromaidan (protests, pro-European)
- Russia annexes Crimea (March 2014, illegal)
- War in Donbas (Eastern Ukraine, Russian-backed separatists)
- 2022: Full-scale invasion (February 24)
  - Ongoing war, massive destruction, deaths

**Anthropology:**
- **Serguei Oushakine:** Patriotism, post-Soviet Russia
- **Alexei Yurchak:** *Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More* (2005)
  - Late Soviet generation
  - Ideology (performed, but not believed)
  - Imagining futures (impossible until suddenly possible)

---

## EU Expansion

### Eastern Integration

**Waves:**
- 2004: Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania (+Malta, Cyprus)
- 2007: Romania, Bulgaria
- 2013: Croatia

**Benefits:**
- Free movement (labor, travel)
- Economic development (EU funds)
- Political stability

**Challenges:**
- Brain drain (young, educated migrate west)
- Economic inequality (EU core vs. periphery)
- Political tensions (Hungary, Poland vs. EU, rule of law issues)

**Brexit:**
- UK leaves EU (2020)
- Immigration partly motivating (Eastern Europeans to UK)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Was shock therapy necessary or avoidable disaster?

**Question 2:** Is nostalgia for socialism rational or irrational?

**Question 3:** Why did democracy disappoint in Eastern Europe?

**Question 4:** Can post-socialist countries "catch up" to the West?

**Question 5:** What are the long-term legacies of communism?
