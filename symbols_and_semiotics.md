# Symbols and Semiotics: The Anthropology of Meaning

---

## What Are Symbols?

**Symbol:**
- Something that stands for something else
- Arbitrary relationship (no natural connection)
- Culturally learned
- Shared meanings
- Essential to human communication

**Humans = Symbol-Using Animals:**
- Language, gesture, objects, rituals
- Create and manipulate symbols
- Build worlds of meaning

**Anthropology's Core:**
- Understanding symbolic systems
- How meanings made, shared, contested
- Cultural analysis

## Semiotics: The Science of Signs

### Charles Sanders Peirce: Triadic Sign

**Peirce (1839-1914):**
- American philosopher
- Founded semiotics
- Three-part sign

**Sign Relation:**
1. **Representamen** (sign vehicle)
2. **Object** (what it refers to)
3. **Interpretant** (meaning in mind)

**Three Types of Signs:**

**1. Icon:**
- Resemblance to object
- Looks like, sounds like
- Portrait, photograph, onomatopoeia
- Motivated relationship

**2. Index:**
- Causal/physical connection
- Smoke → fire
- Footprint → person
- Symptom → disease
- Natural connection

**3. Symbol:**
- Arbitrary, conventional
- No natural connection
- Words, flags, gestures (most)
- Must be learned

**Example:**
- Word "tree" (English) = symbol
- Photo of tree = icon
- Tree rings = index (tree's age)

**Importance:**
- All signs combine types
- Analytically useful distinction

### Ferdinand de Saussure: Dyadic Sign

**Saussure (1857-1913):**
- Swiss linguist
- Structural linguistics
- Influenced structuralism

**Sign (French: signe):**
1. **Signifier** (signifiant): sound/image
2. **Signified** (signifié): concept/meaning

**Key Principles:**

**Arbitrariness:**
- No natural link signifier-signified
- "Tree" in English, "arbre" French, "árbol" Spanish
- Different sounds, same concept
- Conventional

**Value Through Difference:**
- Meaning from contrasts
- "Hot" meaningful because ≠ "cold"
- Binary oppositions
- System of differences

**Synchronic vs. Diachronic:**
- Synchronic: language at moment (structure)
- Diachronic: language over time (history)
- Focus on synchronic

**Langue vs. Parole:**
- Langue: language system (abstract)
- Parole: actual speech (individual)
- Study langue

**Influence:**
- Structuralism (Lévi-Strauss)
- Semiotics
- Literary theory

## Clifford Geertz: Symbols and Culture

### "Thick Description" (1973)

**Geertz's Program:**
- Culture = systems of symbols
- Interpretation essential
- "Thick description" vs. "thin"

**Thick Description:**
- Not just behavior (thin)
- Meaning, context, interpretation (thick)
- Ethnographer as interpreter

**Famous Example: Wink**

**Thin:**
- Eye closing

**Thick:**
- Wink = communication
- Conspiratorial, flirtatious, joking
- Depends on context
- Layers of meaning
- "Winking about winking"

**Culture as Text:**
- Read culture like text
- Interpret meanings
- Hermeneutic approach

### Balinese Cockfight (1973)

**Geertz's Classic Essay:**

**The Event:**
- Bali, cockfighting (betting, excitement)
- Illegal but widespread
- Men's world

**Not Just Sport:**
- "Deep play" (Bentham)
- Status competition
- Symbolic expression
- Masculinity, hierarchy, village rivalry

**"Story Balinese Tell Themselves About Themselves":**
- Not about money (bets irrational economically)
- About status, honor, aesthetics
- Symbolic drama
- Society reading itself

**Interpretation:**
- Geertz reads as text
- Reveals Balinese meanings
- Status, power, affect

**Critique:**
- Too focused on meaning
- Ignores power, politics, economy
- Women absent
- Whose interpretation?

**But Influential:**
- Interpretive anthropology
- Symbols central
- Meaning matters

## Victor Turner: Ritual Symbols

### Multivocal Symbols

**Turner's Insight:**
- Symbols have multiple meanings
- "Multivocal" or "polysemic"
- Condense many meanings

**Ndembu Milk Tree (Mudyi):**

**Meanings:**
1. **Exegetical** (what Ndembu say):
   - Matriliny
   - Mother's milk
   - Ndembu society
   - Women, nourishment

2. **Operational** (what happens):
   - Ritual actions around tree
   - Girls initiated
   - Community gathers

3. **Positional** (relation to other symbols):
   - Contrasts with men's symbols
   - Part of ritual system

**Three Poles of Meaning:**

**Ideological Pole:**
- Social, moral norms
- Society, values

**Sensory Pole:**
- Physical, emotional
- Body, affect

**Symbols Unite:**
- Connect bodily to social
- Powerful because both
- "Mudyi tree" = milk (body) + matriliny (society)

### Dominant vs. Instrumental Symbols

**Dominant:**
- Central, recurrent
- Multiple rituals
- Ends in themselves
- Mudyi tree, cross, flag

**Instrumental:**
- Specific to ritual
- Means to ends
- Temporary

## Mary Douglas: Purity and Classification

### "Purity and Danger" (1966)

**Key Argument:**
- Dirt = "matter out of place"
- Pollution = category violation
- Order through classification

**Not About Hygiene:**
- Symbolic order
- Boundaries maintained
- Danger in margins, ambiguity

**Example: Kashrut (Jewish Dietary Laws)**

**Leviticus:**
- Clean animals: cloven hoof + cud-chewing
- Pig: cloven hoof but no cud = unclean
- Shellfish: no fins/scales = unclean

**Douglas's Interpretation:**
- Not health reasons
- Symbolic classification
- Proper categories = pure
- Category violations = impure
- Maintains order

**Criticism:**
- Over-systematizes
- Functionalist
- But insight: symbols classify, order world

### Body as Symbol

**"Natural Symbols" (1970):**

**Body = Symbol of Society:**
- How we treat body reflects social structure
- Bodily control ↔ social control
- Margins of body ↔ social margins

**Grid and Group:**
- **Grid**: Classification, rules
- **Group**: Social incorporation
- Different societies different body symbolism

**Example:**
- Tight social control → tight bodily control
- Loose social → relaxed bodily

## Lévi-Strauss: Structural Analysis

### Binary Oppositions

**Structuralism:**
- Universal mental structures
- Binary oppositions fundamental
- Nature/Culture, Raw/Cooked, etc.

**"The Raw and the Cooked" (1964):**

**Culinary Triangle:**
- Raw (nature)
- Cooked (culture)
- Rotten (nature returns)

**Cooking = Culture:**
- Transformation of nature
- Fire, hearth = civilization
- Symbolic mediation

**Myths:**
- Play with oppositions
- Transform, mediate
- Never resolve (can't)
- Structural logic

**Amazon Myths:**
- Hundreds analyzed
- All transformations of same structure
- Origin of cooking, fire, water

**Critique:**
- Ahistorical
- Ignores practice, power
- Too abstract
- Western bias?

**But Influential:**
- Pattern recognition
- Comparative method
- Cognitive dimension

## Performance and Performativity

### J.L. Austin: "How to Do Things With Words" (1962)

**Speech Acts:**
- Language doesn't just describe
- **Performative utterances** = do things

**Examples:**
- "I pronounce you married"
- "I name this ship..."
- "I bet..."

**Saying = Doing:**
- Not reporting action
- Performing action
- Creates reality

**Conditions:**
- Must be appropriate context
- Speaker authorized
- Conventions followed

**Influence on Anthropology:**
- Ritual as performative
- Symbols don't just mean—they do
- Action creates reality

### Judith Butler: Gender as Performance

**"Gender Trouble" (1990):**

**Gender = Performative:**
- Not essence
- Repeated stylized acts
- "Doing gender"
- Creates illusion of substance

**No "Being" Before "Doing":**
- Gender through performance
- Drag makes visible
- Parody reveals construction

**Influence:**
- Gender studies
- Anthropology of body, identity
- Performance ethnography

## Symbolism of Objects

### Material Culture

**Objects Are Symbols:**
- Communicate meaning
- Identity, status, values
- Not just utilitarian

**Arjun Appadurai, "The Social Life of Things" (1986):**

**Things Have Biographies:**
- Produced, exchanged, consumed
- Meanings change
- Commodity → gift → heirloom
- Context-dependent

**Regimes of Value:**
- Different spheres
- Kula valuables ≠ commodities
- Conversion contested

**Diversion:**
- Moving things between spheres
- Creative, political
- Example: Art market

### Alfred Gell: "Art and Agency" (1998)

**Art Objects Have Agency:**
- Not passive
- Do things, affect people
- "Social agents"

**Art = Technology of Enchantment:**
- Captivates, fascinates
- Technical virtuosity
- Agency through difficulty
- "How did they do that?"

**Example:**
- Marquesan tattoos
- Capture eye, mesmerize
- Trap observer
- Agency of object

**Not About Aesthetics:**
- Function, agency
- Social effects
- Cross-cultural

**Critique:**
- Downplays meaning, beauty
- But influential: objects as actors

## Color Symbolism

### Berlin and Kay: Basic Color Terms (1969)

**Universals:**
- Languages have 2-11 basic color terms
- Evolutionary sequence:
  1. Black/white
  2. +Red
  3. +Green or yellow
  4. +Both
  5. +Blue
  6. +Brown
  7. +Purple, pink, orange, grey

**Challenged Relativism:**
- Not arbitrary
- Biological constraints
- Universal patterns

**Critique:**
- Tested on industrialized societies mostly
- Some languages don't fit
- Imposition of categories

### Cultural Meanings

**Beyond Biology:**
- Colors have cultural associations
- Red = danger (West), luck (China), purity (India)
- White = purity (West), death (China)
- Context-dependent

**Turner's Tripartite:**
- Ndembu: white, red, black
- Correspond to body products
- Symbolic poles

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Are all meanings ultimately arbitrary (Saussure), or some grounded (Peirce's index/icon)?

**Question 2:** Can anthropologists truly interpret others' symbols, or impose own meanings?

**Question 3:** Do symbols reflect society or create it?

**Question 4:** Is "thick description" enough, or must we analyze power, economy too?

**Question 5:** What symbols are most powerful in your life?

- Performance ([[performance_and_narrative.md]])

**Classic Texts:**

**Remember:** Symbols are vehicles of meaning—arbitrary signs learned culturally. Peirce distinguished icon, index, symbol. Saussure emphasized arbitrariness and difference. Geertz made interpretation central—culture as text, thick description. Turner showed symbols multivocal, condensing many meanings. Douglas revealed pollution as category violation, body as symbol of society. Lévi-Strauss found binary oppositions structuring thought. Performativity (Austin, Butler) shows symbols don't just mean—they do, create reality. Objects have social lives and agency. Understanding symbolism reveals how humans create, share, contest meaning—the core of culture itself.
