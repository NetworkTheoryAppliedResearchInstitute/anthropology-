**Remember:** Aging is biological but culturally interpreted—meanings vary. Gerontocracy in some societies (Samburu, Australian Aboriginal, Confucian). Elder status declined with modernization (Cowgill & Holmes). Active aging ideology (US). Intergenerational relations vary (co-residence vs. independence). Eldercare by family (usually women) or institutions. Migration complicates care (Lamb, Coe). Dementia culturally understood. Retirement modern invention. Death and dying culturally shaped—good death varies (US hospice, Hindu Benares, Toraja delayed funerals). Mortuary practices enormously varied (sky burial, endocannibalism, burial, cremation). Mourning cultural. Ancestors remain present (worship, offerings). Ghosts when death improper. Afterlife beliefs varied. Life course perspective shows stages cultural, not natural. Understanding aging/death anthropology reveals how societies manage final transitions—elderhood, dying, death always cultural, historical, meaningful. Life course is cultural construction from birth to death.
