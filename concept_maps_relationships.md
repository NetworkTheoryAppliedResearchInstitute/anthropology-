# Knowledge Architecture: Concept Maps and Relationships

## Core Conceptual Architecture

### The Central Hub: CULTURE

**Culture** is the organizing concept that connects everything in anthropology.

**Direct connections:**
- Cultural Relativism (how to approach culture ethically)
- Holism (culture as integrated whole)
- Emic/Etic (perspectives on culture)
- Fieldwork (method for studying culture)
- Four Fields (different aspects of culture: symbolic, biological, material, linguistic)

**Radiates to all domains:**
- Kinship (cultural organization of relatedness)
- Economics (cultural organization of production/exchange)
- Politics (cultural organization of power)
- Religion (cultural systems of meaning)
- Language (cultural communication)
- Gender (cultural construction of sex)
- Medical (cultural understanding of health)

## Foundational Concept Cluster

### Tier 1: Must Understand First

These concepts are prerequisites for everything else:

**1. Culture**
- Learned, shared, symbolic, adaptive
- NOT race, nationality, or biology
- Dynamic, not static
→ Required for: ALL subsequent topics

**2. Cultural Relativism**
- Suspend judgment to understand
- Methodological, not moral
- Limits and ethical boundaries
→ Required for: Ethics, cross-cultural comparison, ALL ethnographic examples

**3. Holism**
- Interconnected whole
- Four fields integration
- Multiple dimensions (economic, political, social, symbolic)
→ Required for: Understanding how topics connect, comparative method

**4. Emic/Etic**
- Insider vs. outsider perspectives
- Both necessary
- Tension between them
→ Required for: Interpreting ethnography, understanding debates

**5. Fieldwork/Ethnography**
- Participant observation
- The defining method
- Ethical issues
→ Required for: Understanding how we know what we know, evaluating claims

## Four Fields Cluster

### Interconnected Subfields

**Cultural/Social Anthropology** ↔ **Biological Anthropology**
- Bio-cultural (e.g., diet/nutrition, disease/culture, race as social construct)
- Human variation (shaped by culture AND biology)
- Medical anthropology (bridge between)

**Cultural Anthropology** ↔ **Archaeology**
- Material culture (objects = cultural meaning)
- Ethnoarchaeology (living peoples inform past interpretation)
- Historical anthropology (documents + archaeology + ethnography)

**Cultural Anthropology** ↔ **Linguistic Anthropology**
- Language = culture (reflects and shapes cultural categories)
- Discourse (creates social reality)
- Ethnography of communication

**Archaeology** ↔ **Biological Anthropology**
- Bioarchaeology (skeletal remains = health, diet, violence)
- Evolution (hominin fossils + material culture)
- Paleopathology (ancient disease)

**ALL FIELDS:**
- Share holistic perspective
- Comparative method
- Evolutionary deep time
- Human diversity
