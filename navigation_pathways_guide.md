# Knowledge Architecture: Navigation Guide and Learning Pathways

---

## Overview: Multiple Routes Through Anthropology

The knowledge base is **non-linear**. There are many valid starting points depending on learner interests and goals.

**Core principle:** Meet learners where they are, guide them where they want to go.

---

## Quick-Start by Interest

### "I care about current events / social justice"
**Start:** Contemporary issues
- Climate change → Environmental anthropology, political ecology
- Migration/refugees → Transnationalism, borders, nationalism
- Racial justice → Race as social construct, structural racism
- Digital surveillance → Algorithmic bias, platform capitalism
- Pandemic → Medical anthropology, global health

**Then:** Connect to theoretical frameworks and history

---

### "I love stories and travel"
**Start:** Vivid ethnographic examples
- Trobriand kula ring → Exchange, reciprocity
- Nacirema → Defamiliarization

**Then:** Extract concepts and theories from stories

---

### "I'm taking an anthropology course"
**Start:** Foundations in order
1. Culture concept
2. Cultural relativism
3. Holism
4. Four fields
5. Theoretical timeline
6. Core domains (kinship, economics, politics, religion, gender)

**Then:** Systematic coverage of all subfields

---

- Economics (cultural organization of production/exchange)
- Politics (cultural organization of power)
- Religion (cultural systems of meaning)
- Language (cultural communication)
- Gender (cultural construction of sex)
- Medical (cultural understanding of health)

**Four Fields** interconnect:
- Cultural ↔ Biological (bio-cultural, race, medical)
- Cultural ↔ Archaeological (material culture, ethnoarchaeology)
- Cultural ↔ Linguistic (language = culture, discourse)
- Biological ↔ Archaeological (bioarchaeology, evolution)

**Major domains** link:
- Kinship → Economics (inheritance, exchange)
- Kinship → Politics (lineages, succession)
- Economics → Politics (class, taxation, redistribution)
- Politics → Religion (legitimation, theocracy)
- Religion → Healing (medical systems)
- Gender → ALL (intersects everything)
