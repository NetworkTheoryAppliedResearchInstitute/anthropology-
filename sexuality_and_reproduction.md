# Sexuality, Reproduction, and Gender Violence

---

## Sexuality Cross-Culturally

### Beyond Heteronormativity

**Western Assumption:**
- Heterosexuality = natural, universal norm
- Homosexuality = deviation
- Binary (gay/straight)

**Anthropology Shows:**
- Enormous sexual diversity
- Different categories, meanings
- "Homosexuality" not universal category
- Context matters

---

## Same-Sex Sexuality Globally

### Gilbert Herdt: Sambia (Papua New Guinea)

**"Guardians of the Flutes" (1981):**

**Ritual Homosexuality:**
- Boys (ages 7-15) perform fellatio on older bachelors
- Ingest semen
- Believed necessary for masculinity
- "Grow" through semen

**Life Stages:**
- Boys: recipients
- Bachelors: donors
- After marriage: heterosexual
- Not "gay" identity

**Insight:**
- Same-sex acts ≠ identity
- Culturally specific meanings
- Not "homosexual" (Western category)

**Critique:**
- Power imbalance
- "Ritual" vs. "abuse" debates
- Complex ethics

### Ancient Greece

**Classical Athens:**
- **Pederasty** (institutionalized)
- Older man (erastes) + adolescent boy (eromenos)
- Educational, erotic
- Respected (if roles maintained)

**Not "Homosexuality":**
- Role-based (active/passive)
- Age-stratified
- Expected phase
- Later marry women

**Michel Foucault:**
- "History of Sexuality"
- Ancient sexuality ≠ modern
- Categories change historically

### Lesotho: "Mummy-Baby" Relationships

**Judith Gay (1986):**

**Boarding Schools:**
- Older girls ("mommies") + younger girls ("babies")
- Romantic, sexual relationships
- Letters, gifts, intimacy

**Not "Lesbian":**
- Girls later marry men
- No lesbian identity
- Contextual practice

**Gender Segregation:**
- Creates same-sex intimacy
- Not about orientation

## Sexuality and Identity

### Construction of Sexual Identity

**Western "Homosexuality":**
- 19th century invention
- Medical category
- Identity, not just acts
- Foucault's argument

**Before:**
- Sodomy = acts
- Anyone could do
- Not identity

**After:**
- "Homosexual" = type of person
- Essential identity
- Pathologized, then normalized

### "Coming Out"

**Western LGBTQ+:**
- Coming out = crucial
- Authentic self
- Visibility

**Not Universal:**
- Many cultures: acts ≠ identity
- No "closet" to come out of
- Different models

**Example: Latin America**
- Activo/pasivo (active/passive)
- Role matters more than gender of partner
- Activo men not "gay"
- Different system

---

## "Ritualized Homosexuality" Debates

### Melanesia

**Herdt Identified:**
- 50+ Melanesian societies
- Ritual same-sex practices
- Insemination beliefs
- Boys grow through semen

**Debates:**

**1. Naming:**
- "Ritualized homosexuality" appropriate?
- Imposes Western category?
- "Boy-inseminating practices" better?

**2. Power:**
- Abuse? Consent?
- Age, power differential
- Cultural relativism limits?

**3. Secrecy:**
- Women excluded
- Not told (officially)
- Gender segregation extreme

**Anthropological Dilemma:**
- Describe without judgment?
- Or critique?
- Ethics complex

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is sexual orientation universal, or culturally constructed?

**Question 4:** Is gender violence inevitable, or preventable through cultural change?

**Question 5:** How do you navigate sexual norms and expectations?

**Remember:** Sexuality is culturally constructed—same-sex practices ≠ Western "homosexuality" (Sambia, ancient Greece, Lesotho). Sexual identity emerged historically (Foucault). Women's sexuality often controlled more than men's (honor-shame, double standards). Conception beliefs vary (Trobriands, Telefolmin). Birth practices differ (Jordan's four cultures). Reproductive technologies transform kinship. Gender violence is widespread—domestic violence, rape, femicide, FGM. Structural violence (Scheper-Hughes) shows poverty kills. Rape-prone vs. rape-free cultures (Sanday) show violence not inevitable. Women resist, organize. Anthropology documents, analyzes, sometimes advocates. Understanding sexuality, reproduction, violence reveals how cultures organize intimacy, bodies, power—and how these arrangements can change.
