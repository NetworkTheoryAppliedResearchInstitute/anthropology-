# Practice Theory: Structure, Agency, and Habitus (1970s-Present)

---

## Beyond the Structure-Agency Divide

By the 1980s-90s, anthropology faced a theoretical impasse:

**Structuralism, functionalism, Marxism:** Structures determine behavior—people are products of their societies.

**Interpretive anthropology, phenomenology:** People create meaning through agency—culture is what people do.

**The Problem:** Both seem partly right. How can structure AND agency both be true?

**Practice theory** emerged to transcend this divide: **People act within structures, but their actions also reproduce and transform those structures.**

This wasn't just theoretical elegance—it was trying to understand how cultures both persist AND change, how people are both constrained AND creative.

## Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002): The Architect

**Background:**
- French sociologist/anthropologist
- Fieldwork in Algeria during colonial war
- Later studied French education, taste, culture
- Politically engaged intellectual

**Major Works:**
- *Outline of a Theory of Practice* (1972/1977)
- *Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste* (1979/1984)
- *The Logic of Practice* (1980/1990)

**Bourdieu's Project:**
Overcome false oppositions:
- Structure vs. agency
- Objective vs. subjective  
- Materialism vs. idealism
- Society vs. individual

## Core Concepts

### 1. Habitus

**The central concept:**

**Habitus** = embodied dispositions, internalized structures that generate practices.

**Definition:**
> "Systems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures."

**Translation:**
- Structured structures: Shaped by your social position and experiences
- Structuring structures: Generate your practices and perceptions
- Durable: Persist over time
- Transposable: Apply across contexts

**In simpler terms:**

Habitus is like a **feel for the game**:
- Soccer players develop intuitions about positioning, passing, timing
- Don't consciously calculate—it's embodied knowledge
- Developed through practice, becomes second nature
- Allows improvisation within structure

> **Example: Table Manners**
>
> Upper-class child learns:
> - Which fork for which course
> - How to hold utensils
> - Posture at table
> - Conversation topics during meals
>
> This isn't conscious rule-following—it's embodied habitus:
> - Feels "natural"
> - Marks class position
> - Automatically reproduced
> - But also allows improvisation
>
> Working-class child develops different habitus—different postures, eating styles, comfort levels. Both are structured by class position.

**Key Features:**

**1. Unconscious:**
Most habitus operates below conscious awareness—it's "common sense," "natural," "obvious."

**2. Embodied:**
Not just mental—bodily hexis (posture, gesture, gait, accent).

**3. Social:**
Produced by social position (class, gender, ethnicity, etc.).

**4. Generative:**
Not rigid rules but flexible dispositions that generate varied practices.

**5. Conservative:**
Tends to reproduce existing structures (people act in ways that confirm their position).

**6. But Not Deterministic:**
Allows creativity, adaptation, change—especially when habitus meets new fields.

### 2. Field (Champ)

**Field** = structured social space with its own logic, stakes, and capital.

**Examples of Fields:**
- Academic field (universities, journals, conferences)
- Artistic field (galleries, critics, museums)
- Economic field (markets, corporations, finance)
- Political field (parties, elections, government)
- Religious field (churches, clergy, theology)

**Each Field Has:**

**1. Positions:**
- Dominant vs. subordinate
- Established vs. newcomers
- Orthodox vs. heretical

**2. Capital:**
What's valued in that field:
- Economic capital (money, property)
- Cultural capital (education, taste, knowledge)
- Social capital (networks, connections)
- Symbolic capital (prestige, honor, recognition)

**3. Stakes:**
What people compete for (grants, tenure, sales, power).

**4. Logic:**
Rules of the game (often implicit, taken-for-granted).

**5. Doxa:**
Unquestioned beliefs, what "goes without saying."

> **Example: Academic Field**
>
> **Positions:** Tenured professors vs. adjuncts, elite universities vs. community colleges
>
> **Capital valued:**
> - Cultural: PhD, publications, citations
> - Social: Networks, mentors, collaborations
> - Symbolic: Prestigious awards, named chairs
>
> **Stakes:** Tenure, grants, recognition, influence
>
> **Logic:** Peer review, publish or perish, academic freedom
>
> **Doxa:** Knowledge for its own sake is valuable, expertise matters, academic autonomy

### 3. Capital

**Different forms of capital:**

**Economic Capital:**
Money, property, assets—most straightforward.

**Cultural Capital:**
Three forms:
- **Embodied:** Knowledge, skills, education, taste, accent
- **Objectified:** Books, art, instruments owned
- **Institutionalized:** Degrees, credentials, titles

> **Example:**
> Elite families give children:
> - Museum visits (embodied cultural capital)
> - Classical music lessons (embodied + objectified)
> - Private school education (institutionalized)
>
> This cultural capital helps maintain class privilege.

**Social Capital:**
Networks, connections, relationships that can be mobilized.

**Symbolic Capital:**
Prestige, honor, recognition, legitimacy.

**Capital is:**
- Convertible (money → education → prestige)
- Accumulates (those with capital gain more)
- Reproduces inequality (capital begets capital)

### 4. Symbolic Violence

**The most insidious form of domination:**

**Symbolic violence** = domination that is misrecognized as legitimate.

**Not physical force but:**
- Seems natural
- Is internalized
- Appears consensual
- Victims participate in their own domination

> **Example: Educational System**
>
> **Appears:** Meritocratic—smartest succeed
>
> **Actually:** 
> - Upper-class children have cultural capital that school values
> - Working-class children lack this capital
> - School "neutrally" tests knowledge that privileged children already have
> - Failure seems like personal inadequacy, not structural inequality
>
> **Result:** Educational failure is misrecognized as individual failure rather than class reproduction.

**The Power:** Domination isn't recognized as domination—it's experienced as natural order.

### 5. Distinction and Taste

**"Distinction" (1984) showed:**

**Taste is social, not natural:**
- What you like isn't personal preference
- It marks social position
- Serves to distinguish classes

**Class Differences in Taste:**

**Upper class:**
- "Pure" aesthetic (art for art's sake)
- Formal dining, haute cuisine
- Classical music, literature
- Delayed gratification
- Distance from necessity

**Middle class:**
- Cultural goodwill (trying to appreciate "legitimate" culture)
- Striving, earnest
- Self-improvement
- Ambitious taste

**Working class:**
- Functional aesthetic (judging by use, not form)
- Hearty food, quantity
- Popular culture
- Immediate gratification
- Necessity shapes taste

**These aren't just differences—they're hierarchical:**
- Upper-class taste defines "good taste"
- Working-class taste is devalued
- Cultural capital reinforces economic privilege

## Sherry Ortner: Practice Theory in Anthropology

**Ortner brought practice theory to American anthropology:**

**"Theory in Anthropology Since the Sixties" (1984):**

Identified practice theory as major trend synthesizing:
- Structure (Marxism, structuralism)
- Agency (interpretive anthropology)
- History (historical materialism)

**Key Points:**

**1. Practice is Central:**
What people actually do, not just structures or meanings.

**2. Structure and Practice Mutually Constituting:**
- Structures shape practice
- Practice reproduces or transforms structures
- Dialectical relationship

**3. History Matters:**
Practices unfold in time, change, have consequences.

**4. Power Central:**
Practice always involves differential power, inequality, domination.

**Ortner's Ethnography:**

> **Sherpas (Nepal):**
>
> Showed how:
> - Buddhist monasteries structure Sherpa society
> - But Sherpa founders actively created monasteries
> - Religious practice both constrains and enables
> - Historical changes in monastic founding
> - Gender, class, age affect participation
>
> Structure AND agency, history, power—all integrated.

## Other Practice Theorists

### Anthony Giddens: Structuration Theory

**British sociologist, similar project:**

**Structuration:** Structures are both medium and outcome of practices.

**Duality of Structure:**
- Structures enable action (provide resources, rules)
- Action reproduces structures
- Not separate but mutually constituting

**Practical Consciousness:**
Knowledge actors have but can't always articulate—like Bourdieu's habitus.

### Michel de Certeau: Tactics and Strategies

**Everyday practices of resistance:**

**Strategies:** Used by powerful (institutions, corporations, states)—create spaces they control.

**Tactics:** Used by less powerful—maneuver within others' spaces.

> **Example: Workers in Factory**
>
> **Management strategy:** Control space, time, production
>
> **Worker tactics:** 
> - Slowdowns
> - Taking breaks
> - Sabotage
> - Jokes, gossip
> - "Weapons of the weak"
>
> Not revolution but everyday resistance within structure.

### Marshall Sahlins: Structure and History

**Pacific Islander cultures:**

**"Islands of History" (1985):**

Showed how:
- Hawaiian structures shaped encounter with Captain Cook
- Cook's arrival transformed Hawaiian categories
- Historical events change structures
- Structure in practice = historical transformation

**Not static structures but structures transforming through practice in history.**

## Anthropological Applications

### 1. Embodiment and the Body

**Thomas Csordas, Paul Stoller:** Bodies are sites of cultural practice.

**Not body as symbol but:**
- Embodied practices
- Bodily knowledge
- Sensory experience
- Practical consciousness

> **Example: Religious Healing**
>
> Not just beliefs about healing but:
> - Bodily experiences during rituals
> - Sensations, emotions, movements
> - Embodied knowledge of healer and patient
> - Practice producing transformation

### 2. Gender as Practice

**Beyond gender as role or identity:**

**Judith Butler (influenced by practice theory):**
- Gender is performative—enacted through repeated practices
- No gender "essence"—only citational performances
- But performances constrained by structures

**Anthropologists showing:**
- How gendered habitus is produced
- Gendered practices reproduce inequality
- But also spaces for transgression

### 3. Ritual and Performance

**Catherine Bell:**
- Ritual as practice (not just symbolic meaning)
- Bodies doing ritual
- Ritualization as strategy of power

**Beyond Geertz's interpretation:**
- What ritual does, not just means
- How ritual creates dispositions
- Power in ritual practice

### 4. Economic Practices

**Beyond rational choice or cultural meanings:**

**Pierre Bourdieu on economy:**
- Economic habitus (feel for markets)
- Practical sense in economic action
- Cultural capital in economic fields

**Economic anthropology:**
- Practices of exchange
- Embodied economic knowledge
- Cultural economy

### 5. Resistance and Agency

**James Scott, "Weapons of the Weak":**

Everyday forms of resistance:
- Not organized revolution
- But foot-dragging, dissimulation, sabotage, pilfering
- Within structures but against domination
- Practice of subordinate groups

**Saba Mahmood, "Politics of Piety":**

Egyptian women's mosque movement:
- Not resistance in Western feminist terms
- But cultivating pious habitus
- Agency through submission
- Challenges Western assumptions about agency

## Critiques of Practice Theory

### 1. Still Too Deterministic?

**Critique:** Habitus seems to lock people into reproducing their position.

- If working-class habitus produces working-class practices, how does change happen?
- Seems circular: structure → habitus → practice → structure

**Response:** Habitus CAN change (field-habitus mismatch, historical transformation). But critics say Bourdieu underplays this.

### 2. Underplays Conscious Reflection

**Critique:** People DO consciously strategize, reflect, calculate.

Not everything is "practical sense"—sometimes we think explicitly about what we're doing.

**Response:** Bourdieu acknowledges this but emphasizes most practice is prereflective.

### 3. Difficult Empirically

**Critique:** How do you study habitus? It's unconscious, embodied, implicit.

Can't just ask people (they don't consciously know their habitus). Have to infer from practices. Risk of circular reasoning.

### 4. Conservative Bias?

**Critique:** Emphasizes reproduction over transformation.

Like functionalism, seems to explain stability better than change.

**Response:** Later work emphasized hysteresis (habitus lagging behind field changes), creating possibilities for transformation.

### 5. Individual or Collective?

**Critique:** Is habitus individual or class-based?

If class habitus, erases individual variation. If individual, loses structural analysis.

**Response:** Habitus is socially patterned but individually embodied—both.

## Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

### What Practice Theory Contributed:

**1. Synthesized Structure and Agency:**
Don't have to choose—both matter, mutually constituting.

**2. Embodiment Central:**
Culture isn't just ideas—it's embodied, practical, lived.

**3. Power in Everyday Life:**
Not just institutions but daily practices reproduce domination.

**4. Beyond Meaning or Function:**
What culture **does**, not just what it means or what function it serves.

**5. Historical Dynamism:**
Structures change through practice over time.

### Contemporary Applications:

**Medical Anthropology:**
- Embodiment of illness
- Habitus of health practices
- Medical field and capitals

**Migration Studies:**
- Transnational habitus
- Navigating multiple fields
- Cultural capital across borders

**Digital Culture:**
- Online practices
- Digital habitus
- Virtual fields

**Environmental Anthropology:**
- Practices of sustainability
- Ecological habitus
- Environmental fields

**Inequality Studies:**
- How privilege is reproduced daily
- Cultural capital in education
- Symbolic violence in institutions

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Do you have a habitus? Can you identify dispositions that feel natural but are socially produced?

**Question 2:** Is Bourdieu right that taste marks class, or can people genuinely like what they like regardless of social position?

**Question 3:** If habitus tends to reproduce structures, how does radical social change happen?

**Question 4:** Can you identify symbolic violence in your own society—domination that seems legitimate?

**Question 5:** Does practice theory successfully bridge structure and agency, or does it still lean toward structural determinism?

**Remember:** Practice theory transformed anthropology by insisting we must analyze what people actually do—their embodied practices—not just abstract structures or symbolic meanings. Bourdieu's concepts (habitus, field, capital) remain foundational for understanding how inequality is reproduced in everyday life. But practice theory works best when combined with attention to conscious reflection, historical change, and possibilities for transformation that Bourdieu sometimes underplays. Contemporary anthropology uses practice theory while adding concerns with affect, ontology, non-human actors, and more radical possibilities for change.
