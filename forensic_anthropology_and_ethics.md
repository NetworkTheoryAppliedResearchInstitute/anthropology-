## Human Rights Investigations

### War Crimes, Genocide

**Application:**
- Document atrocities

- Identifications
- Returned to families
- Evidence for trials

**Methods:**
- Locate graves
- Excavate carefully
- Identify (biological profile, DNA, dental, medical records)
- Trauma analysis (torture, execution)

### Guatemala (Civil War, 1960-96)

**Genocide:**
- 200,000+ killed (mostly Mayan)
- Mass graves

- Defense: science, donors consent

**Expansion:**
- Texas State, Southern Illinois, others
- Regional variation

---

## Ethical Issues

### Working with the Dead

**Respect:**
- Human remains ≠ objects
- Dignity
- Cultural sensitivity

**Questions:**
- Who owns remains?
- Who can study?
- Display in museums?
- Repatriation?

---

## Repatriation

### Returning Remains

**History:**
- Museums, universities collected remains
- Colonialism
- Grave robbing
- Unethical

**Indigenous Peoples:**
- Sacred
- Ancestors
- Should be buried
- Not specimens

---

## NAGPRA

### Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990)

**US Federal Law:**
- Protect Native American burials
- Require repatriation
- Cultural affiliation
- Consultation

**Provisions:**

**Ownership:**
- Remains on federal/tribal land → tribe
- Grave goods too

**Museum Collections:**
- Inventory
- Culturally affiliated → repatriate
- Consultation required

**Inadvertent Discoveries:**
- Construction, etc.
- Stop work, notify
- Consult tribe

**Impact:**
- Thousands repatriated
- Changed archaeology
- Collaborative relationships

**Controversies:**

**Kennewick Man:**
- 9,000 years old (Washington State)
- Tribes claimed
- Anthropologists wanted to study
- Lawsuit (Bonnichsen v. US, 2004)
- Court: not affiliated (too ancient)
- 2015: DNA shows Natives closely related
- 2016: Repatriated, reburied
- Lesson: science vs. cultural rights

---

## International Repatriation

### Global Issues

**Examples:**

**Tasmanian Aborigines:**
- Extinct (genocide)
- Remains in European museums
- Returned (some)

**Maori (New Zealand):**
- Mokomokai (tattooed heads)
- Traded, collected
- Repatriation efforts

**African Remains:**
- Colonial collections
- France, Belgium, Germany
- Repatriation demands

**Challenges:**
- Provenance (where from?)
- Affiliation (descendant communities)
- Museum resistance
- Scientific value?

---

## Ethics of Display

### Museums

**Human Remains on Display:**
- Educational?
- Disrespectful?

**Arguments FOR:**
- Education
- Honor deceased
- Scientific value

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Exploitation
- Lack consent
- Cultural taboos
- Racism (non-Western bodies displayed)

**Examples:**

**Egyptian Mummies:**
- Museums worldwide
- Removed from tombs
- Religious beliefs (afterlife)
- Should rebury?

**Pompeii Casts:**
- Victims of eruption
- Plaster casts (voids in ash)
- Display OK? (so old)

**Modern:**
- "Body Worlds" (Gunther von Hagens)
- Plastinated bodies
- Consent (claimed)
- Controversial

---

## Ancestor Ethics

### Indigenous Perspectives

**Not "Specimens":**
- Ancestors, persons
- Spiritual beliefs
- Ongoing relationship
- Burial sacred

**Research:**
- Extract knowledge without respect?
- Benefit whom?
- Colonial legacy

**Vine Deloria Jr.:**
- "Red Earth, White Lies" (1995)
- Critique of anthropology
- Native perspective

**Collaborative Archaeology:**
- Involve descendant communities
- Co-produce knowledge
- Respect values
- Share benefits

---

## Data Sovereignty

### Who Owns Information?

**Genetic Data:**
- Ancient DNA
- Belongs to whom?
- Havasupai case (diabetes research misused)

**Publication:**
- Results public
- Communities may object
- Prior consent crucial

**Databases:**
- DNA databases
- Law enforcement access
- Privacy

**Indigenous Data Sovereignty:**
- Control over own data
- CARE Principles (Collective benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics)

---

## Teaching with Remains

### Educational Use

**Osteology Collections:**
- Universities
- Teaching skeletal anatomy
- Forensic training

**Sources:**
- Donated (medical schools)
- Archaeological (old)
- Unidentified (unclaimed)
- Purchased (India, China - ethical issues)

**Respectful Use:**
- Not props
- Educational context
- Minimize handling
- Store properly
- Consider origin

**Alternatives:**

---

## Consent and Donation

### Body Donation

**Medical Schools:**

- Benefit to society

---

## Future Directions

### Evolving Field

**Technology:**

**Ancestry Estimation:**
- Move away from "race"
- Biogeographic ancestry
- Acknowledge social construction

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Should all human remains in museums be repatriated?

**Question 2:** Is it ethical to display ancient remains (e.g., Egyptian mummies)?

**Question 3:** Who has the right to study human remains?

**Question 4:** Should Kennewick Man have been studied or repatriated?

**Question 5:** How do we balance scientific knowledge with cultural respect?

**Remember:** Forensic anthropology applies skeletal analysis to legal cases—identification, trauma analysis, court testimony. Pioneers: Krogman, Stewart, Clyde Snow (human rights legend Argentina/Guatemala/Yugoslavia), William Bass (Body Farm). Mass disasters: 9/11, DMORT teams, fragmented/commingled remains, DNA primary. Human rights: EAAF Argentina Dirty War (30,000 disappeared), Guatemala FAFG genocide documentation, Srebrenica massacre ICMP (8,000+ killed, 7,000+ identified DNA), Rwanda 800,000. Body Farm (Tennessee, Bass 1972) taphonomy research, decomposition studies, donors consent. Ethics: respect human remains, not objects. Repatriation: NAGPRA (1990) US law—Native American remains/grave goods returned, cultural affiliation, consultation required, Kennewick Man controversy (9,000 years old, 2016 repatriated after DNA showed Native relation). International repatriation: Tasmanian, Maori, African remains from colonial collections. Display ethics: Egyptian mummies, consent, exploitation concerns. Indigenous perspectives: ancestors not specimens (Deloria), collaborative archaeology. Data sovereignty: genetic data ownership, CARE Principles. Teaching collections: donated/unclaimed, respectful use, alternatives (casts, 3D models). Understanding forensic anthropology and ethics reveals powerful applications identifying victims, documenting atrocities, but also colonial legacy, ongoing debates respect vs. science, Indigenous rights—must balance knowledge with cultural sensitivity.
