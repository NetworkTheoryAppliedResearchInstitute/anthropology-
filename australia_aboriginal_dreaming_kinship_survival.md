# Australia: Aboriginal Dreaming, Kinship, and Survival

---

## Aboriginal Australia: Overview

### Deep Time

**Antiquity:**
- Oldest continuous cultures (65,000+ years, evidence)
- Arrived during Pleistocene (Ice Age, lower sea levels)
- Sahul (Australia + New Guinea + Tasmania, connected)

**Population (Pre-Contact):**
- Estimates: 300,000 - 1+ million (debated)
- ~250 language groups
- ~500-600 distinct "tribes" or nations

**Diversity:**
- NOT monolithic (hundreds of distinct cultures)
- Regional variations (desert, tropical, coastal, temperate)
- Languages: Different families (Pama-Nyungan largest, others)

---

## Subsistence and Technology

### Hunter-Gatherers

**Foraging:**
- Hunting (kangaroo, emu, wallaby, goannas, others)
- Gathering (seeds, tubers, fruits, honey)
- Fishing (coastal, riverine, fish traps)

**Fire Management:**
- **"Fire-stick farming"** (controlled burns)
- Mosaic burning (patchwork landscape)
- Promotes new growth (attracts game)
- Maintains diversity (prevents large wildfires)

**Technology:**
- Stone tools (flaked, ground axes)
- Boomerangs (returning and non-returning, hunting)
- Spears, spear-throwers (*woomera*)
- Nets, traps
- Bark canoes (some regions)
- NO agriculture (pre-contact)
- NO pottery (pre-contact)

**Mobility:**
- Semi-nomadic (seasonal movements)
- Territories (specific areas, *country*)
- NOT wandering randomly (deliberate, patterned)

---

## The Dreaming (Dreamtime)

### Cosmology

**Tjukurrpa (Pitjantjatjara), Jukurrpa (Warlpiri), many terms:**
- "The Dreaming" (English translation, approximate)

**Concepts:**
- Ancestral beings (creative epoch)
- Created landscape (shaped terrain, waterholes, rocks, animals, plants)
- Created people, laws, ceremonies
- **Not past only** (ongoing, eternal, present)
- Accessible through ritual, song, art

**Country:**
- Land imbued with meaning (Dreaming ancestors traveled, transformed)
- Sacred sites (specific locations, ancestral events)
- Connection to country = identity, spirituality, law

**Songs and Songlines:**
- **Songlines** (Dreaming tracks)
  - Paths ancestors traveled (creating landscape)
  - Encoded in songs (maps, stories, navigation)
  - Sing the country (recreate, maintain)
- Bruce Chatwin: *The Songlines* (1987)
  - Popular book (somewhat romanticized, debated accuracy)

---

## Kinship Systems

### Complexity

**Anthropological Importance:**
- Aboriginal kinship = most complex studied
- Foundational to social anthropology (kinship theory)

**Key Features:**
- **Section systems** (dividing society)
- **Moieties** (dual division, two halves)
- **Subsections** (further divisions, four or eight)
- Marriage rules (complex, based on sections)
- Avoidance relationships (mother-in-law avoidance, some)

---

## Radcliffe-Brown and Australian Kinship

### Foundational Work

**Alfred Radcliffe-Brown:**
- Fieldwork (Western Australia, 1910-1912)
- *The Social Organization of Australian Tribes* (1931)
- Structural-functionalism (kinship as social structure)
- Influenced generations (kinship studies)

**Kariera System:**
- Four-section system
- Marriage rules (cross-cousin marriage)
- Terminological patterns

**Critiques:**
- Overly formal (models ≠ lived reality)
- Ignored variation, agency
- Synchronic (ignored history, change)

---

## W.E.H. Stanner

### Philosophical Anthropology

**Work:**
- *White Man Got No Dreaming* (1953)
- Central Australia (Murinbata, Northern Territory)

**Insights:**
- The Dreaming (cosmology, philosophy)
- Aboriginal worldview (distinct from Western)
- Continuity (past/present not separate)

**"The Great Australian Silence":**
- Historians ignored Aboriginal history
- Violence erased (frontier wars)

---

## European Colonization

### Invasion

**British Colonization:**
- 1788 (First Fleet, convicts, Sydney)
- Claimed land: **Terra Nullius** ("nobody's land")
  - Legal fiction (ignored Aboriginal ownership)
  - NOT "discovered" (inhabited 65,000+ years)

**Violence:**
- Frontier wars (1788-1930s, ongoing conflicts)
  - Massacres (systematic, widespread)
  - Poisoning (waterholes, flour rations)
  - Shooting parties (hunting Aboriginals)
  - Estimates: Tens of thousands killed (exact numbers unknown)
- Dispossession (loss of land, country)
- Disease (smallpox, others, devastating)

**Tasmania:**
- **Genocide** (recognized by many scholars)
- Tasmanian Aboriginal population: ~3,000-15,000 (pre-contact)
- By 1830s: Nearly extinct (violence, disease, removal)
- **Truganini** (c.1812-1876)
  - Last full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal person (widely claimed, not entirely accurate)
  - Symbolic (end of Tasmanian Aboriginals)
  - Actually: Mixed-descent populations survived

---

## Stolen Generations

### Forced Removal

**Policy:**
- 1910s-1970s (official policies)
- Remove Aboriginal children (especially "half-caste," mixed-descent)
- Place in institutions, foster care, white families

**Goals:**
- Assimilation ("breed out" Aboriginality)
- "Civilize" (Western culture, Christianity)
- Break connection to family, culture, country

**Numbers:**
- Estimates: 10-33% of Aboriginal children removed (1910-1970)
- ~100,000 children (over decades)

**Experiences:**
- Abuse (physical, sexual, emotional)
- Cultural loss (language, identity, family)
- Intergenerational trauma

**Apology:**
- **2008: Prime Minister Kevin Rudd**
  - National apology (Australian Parliament)
  - Acknowledged harm (Stolen Generations)
  - No compensation (apology only)

**Film:**
- *Rabbit-Proof Fence* (2002)
  - Based on true story (three girls escape, walk 1,500 miles home)

---

## Land Rights Movement

### Mabo and Native Title

**Pre-1992:**
- Aboriginal land rights = minimal
- Terra Nullius (legal doctrine, still)

**Mabo v Queensland (1992):**
- **Eddie Mabo** (Meriam, Torres Strait Islander)
- High Court case (challenged Terra Nullius)
- Ruling: Terra Nullius = invalid
  - Aboriginal land ownership existed (common law)
  - **Native Title** recognized

**Wik Decision (1996):**
- Native Title can coexist with pastoral leases

**Native Title Act (1993):**
- Framework (claiming native title)
- Complex (must prove continuous connection to land)
- Limited (development, mining often override)

**Outcomes:**
- Land returned (some areas)
- Recognition (symbolic, legal)
- Challenges: Proof of continuity (difficult after dispossession)

---

## Aboriginal Rights Movement

### Activism

**Key Moments:**

**1938: Day of Mourning**
- Australia Day (January 26, anniversary of colonization)
- Aboriginal protest (Sydney)
- 150th anniversary (1788-1938)
- Demanded citizenship, land rights

**1965: Freedom Rides**
- Inspired by US Civil Rights
- Charles Perkins (Aboriginal student, University of Sydney)
- Bus tour (rural New South Wales)
- Exposed discrimination (segregation, racism)

**1972: Aboriginal Tent Embassy**
- Erected (front of Parliament House, Canberra)
- Protest (land rights)
- Symbolic (Aboriginal sovereignty, separate nation)
- Still exists (on-and-off, landmark)

**1992: Mabo Decision** (see above)

**2008: Apology** (see above)

---

## Contemporary Issues

### Inequality

**Statistics:**
- Life expectancy: ~10 years less (Aboriginal vs. non-Aboriginal)
- Incarceration: Aboriginal people ~3% population, ~30% prisoners
  - Overrepresentation (10x rate)
- Health: Higher rates (diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease)
- Education: Lower completion rates
- Income: Lower average

**Causes:**
- Ongoing effects of colonization (dispossession, trauma)
- Systemic racism
- Poverty (cycles)
- Lack of services (remote communities)

---

## Deaths in Custody

### Crisis

**Royal Commission (1987-1991):**
- Investigated Aboriginal deaths in custody (police, prisons)
- 99 deaths (1980-1989)
- 339 recommendations

**Outcomes:**
- Implementation: Partial (many recommendations ignored)
- Deaths continue (increasing)

**2020+:**
- 500+ Aboriginal deaths in custody (since Royal Commission)
- No convictions (police, guards)
- Protests ("Black Lives Matter" solidarity)

---

## Gap Closing

### Government Initiatives

**"Closing the Gap":**
- Policy framework (2008+)
- Goals: Reduce inequality (health, education, employment)
- Targets: Life expectancy, literacy, employment rates

**Results:**
- Mixed (some progress, many targets missed)
- Critiques: Top-down (not Aboriginal-led)
  - Aboriginal communities not central to design

---

## Art and Cultural Renaissance

### Global Recognition

**Aboriginal Art:**
- Rock art (oldest in world, 65,000+ years)
- Contemporary art (Western Desert Art Movement, 1970s+)
  - Acrylic paintings (dots, designs, Dreaming stories)
  - Papunya Tula (art cooperative, Central Australia)
  - International recognition (museums, auctions, high prices)

**Music:**
- Didgeridoo (traditional instrument, Northern Australia)
- Contemporary musicians (Yothu Yindi, Gurrumul, others)

**Literature:**
- Aboriginal authors (Sally Morgan, Alexis Wright, others)
- *My Place* (Sally Morgan, 1987, autobiography, best-seller)

**Film:**
- *Ten Canoes* (2006, Rolf de Heer, entirely in Aboriginal languages)
- *The Sapphires* (2012)

---

## Anthropology and Aboriginal Australia

### Ethical Questions

**Colonial Anthropology:**
- Early anthropology (collected skulls, bodies, artifacts)
- Salvage paradigm ("dying race," must record before extinction)
- Complicit (colonial project)

**Contemporary:**
- Collaborative research (Aboriginal-led, co-designed)
- Repatriation (human remains, sacred objects)
- Indigenous anthropologists (growing)

**Deborah Bird Rose:**
- *Dingo Makes Us Human* (1992)
- Environmental anthropology (Aboriginal ecology)
- Ethics (care, kinship with country)

**Francesca Merlan:**
- *Caging the Rainbow* (1998)
- Katherine region, Northern Territory
- Identity, race, land claims

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is 65,000 years of continuous culture meaningfully "the same" culture?

**Question 2:** Can Native Title undo 200+ years of dispossession?

**Question 3:** Should Australia change the date of Australia Day (January 26 = invasion day)?

**Question 4:** What does reconciliation require beyond apology?

**Question 5:** How do we understand kinship systems without reducing them to rules?
