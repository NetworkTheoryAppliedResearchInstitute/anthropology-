# Primate Conservation and Ethnoprimatology

---

## Conservation Crisis

### Primates in Danger

**Alarming Statistics:**
- **60% of primate species threatened with extinction**
- **75% have declining populations**
- IUCN Red List (International Union for Conservation of Nature)

**Most Threatened:**
- Great apes (all endangered/critically endangered)
- Lemurs (94% threatened!)
- Asian primates

**Why Study Conservation?**
- Ethical (intrinsic value)
- Ecological (ecosystem roles)
- Scientific (evolutionary relatives)
- Utilitarian (medicines, tourism)

---

## Major Threats

### 1. Habitat Loss

**Deforestation:**
- Agriculture (palm oil, soy, cattle)
- Logging (legal and illegal)
- Mining
- Infrastructure (roads, dams)

**Scale:**
- Tropical forests disappearing rapidly
- Primates mostly forest-dependent
- Fragmentation = small, isolated populations

**Examples:**

**Orangutans:**
- Borneo, Sumatra
- Palm oil plantations
- Lost ~50% habitat
- Critically endangered

**Madagascar Lemurs:**
- Deforestation extreme
- Slash-and-burn agriculture
- Timber extraction
- 94% species threatened

**Atlantic Forest (Brazil):**
- Once vast
- Now <12% remains
- Golden lion tamarins, muriquis endangered

---

### 2. Hunting

**Bushmeat:**
- Primates hunted for food
- Subsistence and commercial
- Africa, Asia

**Scale:**
- Massive in Central/West Africa
- Gorillas, chimps, monkeys
- Unsustainable

**Drivers:**
- Logging roads (access remote areas)
- Urban demand
- Poverty

**Karl Ammann:**
- Photographer, activist
- Exposed bushmeat trade

**Cultural Aspects:**
- Traditional protein source
- Prestige (some cultures)
- But: now commercial, unsustainable

---

### 3. Pet Trade

**Live Capture:**
- Infants taken
- Mothers killed
- High mortality in transport
- Cruel

**Examples:**
- Baby chimps, orangutans
- Slow lorises (Southeast Asia)
- Capuchins, marmosets (Latin America)

**Social Media:**
- Cute videos drive demand
- Normalize ownership
- Illegal but widespread

---

### 4. Human-Primate Conflict

**Competition:**
- Crop raiding (primates eat crops)
- Farmers retaliate
- Property damage

**Examples:**
- Baboons in South Africa
- Macaques in Asia
- Chimps in Uganda

**Solutions Needed:**
- Compensation
- Barriers (electric fences)
- Deterrents
- Community involvement

---

### 5. Disease

**Zoonoses:**
- Diseases jump species
- Human → primate (reverse zoonosis)
- Primate → human

**Threats:**
- Ebola (killed thousands of gorillas)
- Respiratory infections (from humans)
- Anthrax

**Tourism Risk:**
- Close contact
- Disease transmission
- Gorilla trekking (controlled)

---

### 6. Climate Change

**Impacts:**
- Habitat shifts
- Food availability changes
- Range contractions
- Combined with other threats

**Vulnerable:**
- Specialized species (narrow niches)
- Small populations
- Limited dispersal

---

## Conservation Strategies

### Protected Areas

**National Parks, Reserves:**
- Legal protection
- Anti-poaching patrols
- Habitat preservation

**Examples:**
- Gombe, Tanzania (chimps, Goodall)
- Kibale, Uganda (chimps, red colobus)
- Virunga, DRC (mountain gorillas)
- Taï, Ivory Coast (chimps)

**Challenges:**
- Underfunded
- Poaching continues
- "Paper parks" (exist on paper only)
- Local communities excluded (historically)

---

### Community-Based Conservation

**Involve Local People:**
- Traditional conservation often excluded locals
- Resentment, poaching
- New approach: involve communities

**Benefits:**
- Economic (tourism, jobs)
- Pride, stewardship
- Traditional knowledge

**Examples:**

**Mountain Gorillas:**
- Rwanda, Uganda, DRC
- Tourism revenue shares with communities
- Population recovering! (success story)
- ~1,000 individuals (from ~250 in 1980s)

**Community Forests:**
- Indigenous territories
- Often best protected
- Legal recognition important

---

### Ecotourism

**Tourism to Fund Conservation:**
- Gorilla trekking (expensive, limited)
- Raises funds
- Local employment
- Incentive to protect

**Risks:**
- Disease transmission
- Habituation (vulnerability)
- Disruption
- Inequality (who benefits?)

**Regulations:**
- Limit group size
- Keep distance (7 meters, gorillas)
- Mask if sick
- Time limits

---

### Rehabilitation and Reintroduction

**Orphan Sanctuaries:**
- Rescue orphans (bushmeat, pet trade)
- Rehabilitate
- Ideally: return to wild

**Examples:**
- Ngamba Island (Uganda, chimps)
- Sepilok (Malaysia, orangutans)
- Tchimpounga (Congo, chimps)

**Challenges:**
- Difficult to reintroduce
- Need skills, social integration
- Often remain in sanctuary (lifelong care)

**Brigitte Bardot, Jane Goodall:**
- Founded sanctuaries
- Advocacy

---

### Legal Protections

**International:**
- CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species)
- Appendix I (no commercial trade)
- All great apes listed

**National Laws:**
- Vary by country
- Enforcement weak (often)

**Great Ape Project:**
- Advocates rights for great apes
- Personhood, legal standing
- Spain recognized (some rights)

---

## Ethnoprimatology

### Human-Primate Coexistence

**Definition:**
- Study of human-primate interactions
- Cultural, ecological, conservation

**Agustín Fuentes:**
- Leading ethnoprimatologist
- "Humans and primates co-evolved"
- Niche construction
- Mutual impacts

---

## Sacred Monkeys

### Religious Protection

**Hanuman Langurs (India):**
- Sacred (Hindu god Hanuman)
- Tolerated in temples, cities
- Protected
- But: also conflict (crop raiding)

**Toque Macaques (Sri Lanka):**
- Buddhist temples
- Fed by pilgrims
- High densities

**Barbary Macaques (Morocco):**
- Tourism (human-monkey interactions)
- Exploitation concerns

**Benefits:**
- Cultural protection
- Coexistence
- But: not always positive (overpopulation, disease)

---

## Primates in Folklore

### Cultural Meanings

**Vary Widely:**
- Reverence
- Fear
- Kin (some indigenous groups)
- Pests

**Examples:**

**Muriqui (Brazil):**
- "Peaceful ape"
- Karen Strier research
- Symbol of Atlantic Forest

**Orangutans:**
- "Person of the forest" (Malay)
- Mythical connections

**Aye-Aye (Madagascar):**
- Feared (evil omen)
- Killed on sight
- Endangered

---

## Pet Primates

### Ethical Issues

**Problems:**
- Cruel (mothers killed)
- Unsuitable (wild animals)
- Zoonoses (disease risk)
- Abandonment (become unmanageable)

**Campaigns:**
- Education
- Ban pet trade
- Slow loris (viral videos)
  - Tickled lorises (distress, not pleasure)
  - Nocturnal, solitary
  - Venomous bite (defense)
  - Teeth pulled (illegal pet trade)

---

## Medicinal Use

### Traditional Medicine

**Primates Used:**
- Body parts (bones, organs)
- Diseases (folk beliefs)

**China, Southeast Asia:**
- Traditional Chinese Medicine
- Unsustainable

**Conservation:**
- Reduce demand
- Alternatives

---

## Research Ethics

### Invasive vs. Non-Invasive

**Biomedical Research:**
- Chimpanzees used (HIV, hepatitis)
- Controversial
- US ended (2015, NIH)
- Still occurs elsewhere

**Arguments FOR:**
- Medical benefits
- Closest to humans genetically

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Suffering
- Alternatives (in vitro, models)
- Ethical (too similar to us)

**Great Ape Project:**
- No invasive research
- Basic rights

**Field Research:**
- Observation mostly
- Some habituation
- Samples (feces, hair, non-invasive)

---

## Climate and Conservation

### Adapting to Change

**Challenges:**
- Ranges shift
- Food availability
- Competition

**Conservation Response:**
- Corridors (connect habitats)
- Climate modeling
- Adaptive management

---

## Success Stories

### Hope Remains

**Mountain Gorillas:**
- Population increasing

- Community support
- ~1,000 now (was ~250)

**Golden Lion Tamarins (Brazil):**
- Critically endangered
- Breeding programs
- Reintroduction
- Habitat restoration
- Population stable (improving)

**Hainan Gibbon (China):**
- World's rarest primate
- ~30 individuals
- Conservation efforts
- Tiny population but stable

---

## Indigenous Peoples and Primates

### Traditional Stewardship

**Indigenous Territories:**
- Often best-protected forests
- Traditional practices sustainable
- Legal recognition crucial

**Co-Management:**
- Combine traditional + scientific knowledge
- Respectful partnerships

**Examples:**
- Amazon indigenous reserves
- Primate populations higher
- "Fortress conservation" failed
- People-centered approaches better

---

## The Future

### What's Needed?

**Urgently:**
- Protect remaining habitat
- Stop poaching, pet trade
- Reduce human-primate conflict
- Address poverty (root cause)
- Climate action
- Fund conservation
- Political will

**Primatologists' Role:**
- Research
- Advocacy
- Education
- Community engagement

**Jane Goodall (Roots & Shoots):**
- Youth program
- Hope for future
- "Every individual matters"

---

## One Health Approach

### Interconnected Health

**Concept:**
- Human, animal, environmental health linked
- COVID-19 showed this

**Primates:**
- Disease reservoirs
- Sentinels (environmental health)
- Zoonoses risk

**Conservation:**
- Protect habitat = protect health
- Win-win

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Do great apes deserve legal personhood?

**Question 2:** Is ecotourism good or bad for primates?

**Question 3:** Should biomedical research on primates be banned?

**Question 4:** Can we prioritize conservation over human needs (poverty)?

**Question 5:** What's our ethical obligation to our closest relatives?

**Remember:** 60% primate species threatened with extinction, 75% declining populations. Major threats: (1) Habitat loss (deforestation palm oil/logging/agriculture), (2) Hunting (bushmeat commercial scale), (3) Pet trade (cruel, illegal), (4) Human-primate conflict (crop raiding), (5) Disease (Ebola gorillas, reverse zoonosis), (6) Climate change. Conservation strategies: protected areas (underfunded), community-based conservation (Rwanda mountain gorillas success—population recovering!), ecotourism (revenue but disease risk), sanctuaries (Ngamba, Sepilok), CITES legal protections. Ethnoprimatology (Fuentes) studies human-primate coexistence. Sacred monkeys (Hanuman langurs India, cultural protection). Pet primate trade cruel (slow loris videos distress not pleasure). Biomedical research controversial, US ended chimp research 2015. Success stories: mountain gorillas 1,000 (from 250), golden lion tamarins recovering. Indigenous territories best-protected. One Health approach. Goodall's Roots & Shoots. Understanding conservation reveals extinction crisis is urgent, human-caused, solvable with will—we're responsible for our primate relatives' survival.
