# Fire, Language, and Behavioral Modernity: Becoming Human

---

## Fire Use and Control

### Taming Fire

**Importance:**
- Warmth (cold climates)
- Cooking (nutrition, digestion)
- Light (extend day, caves)
- Protection (predators)
- Tool-making (hafting, hardening)
- Social focal point

**Evolutionary Consequences:**
- Smaller guts (cooked food easier to digest)
- Smaller teeth (don't need to chew raw)
- Brain expansion enabled? (Richard Wrangham "Cooking Hypothesis")
- Social bonding (hearth gathering)

---

## Archaeological Evidence for Fire

### When Did Control Begin?

**Challenges:**
- Natural fires occur
- Distinguish controlled vs. wild fire
- Preservation (ash, charcoal fragile)

**Criteria:**
- Hearths (constructed features)
- Repeated use (multiple layers)
- Surrounded by artifacts
- Burned bone (deliberate)
- Deep caves (no natural fire penetration)

---

## Early Evidence (Debated)

### ~1.5 Million Years Ago?

**Koobi Fora (Kenya, ~1.5 mya):**
- Reddened sediments
- Claimed fire
- **Disputed** (natural?)

**Swartkrans (South Africa, ~1.0 mya):**
- Burned bone
- Bob Brain argued controlled fire
- **Skepticism** (could be natural bush fires)

**Gesher Benot Ya'aqov (Israel, ~790,000 years ago):**
- Burned flint, seeds, wood
- Hearth-like concentrations
- **More convincing**
- Homo erectus

**Wonderwerk Cave (South Africa, ~1.0 mya):**
- Ash, burned bone
- Deep in cave (no natural fire)
- **Strong evidence**

---

## Secure Evidence

### ~400,000 Years Ago Onwards

**Widespread by:**
- Middle Pleistocene (~400,000 years ago)
- Europe, Africa, Asia

**Sites:**

**Qesem Cave (Israel, ~400,000-200,000 years ago):**
- Hearths
- Repeated burning
- Homo heidelbergensis

**Schöningen (Germany, ~400,000 years ago):**
- Wooden spears
- Fire use inferred

**Zhoukoudian (China, ~500,000-200,000 years ago):**
- "Peking Man" (Homo erectus)
- Thick ash deposits
- Debated (natural vs. controlled)
- Some layers likely controlled

**Neanderthals:**
- Routine fire use (ubiquitous)
- Hearths well-constructed
- Fire-making capability (not just maintaining wild fires)

**Modern Humans:**
- Universal
- Complex uses (pottery firing, metallurgy later)

---

## Fire-Making Techniques

### How to Start Fire

**Archaeological Evidence:**
- Difficult (no direct evidence)
- Infer from ethnography, experimental

**Methods:**

**Friction:**
- Fire drill (spin stick in notch)
- Fire saw (rub wood on wood)
- Fire plow
- Laborious

**Percussion:**
- Strike flint + iron pyrite → sparks
- Catch in tinder (dry fungus, grass)
- Easier

**Manganese Dioxide:**
- Lowers ignition temperature
- Neanderthals collected (Pech de l'Azé, France)
- Fire-making aid?

**Maintenance:**
- Once started, keep burning
- Transport embers
- Easier than starting anew

---

## Cooking Hypothesis

### Richard Wrangham

**Argument:**
- Cooking = major transition
- ~1.9 million years ago (Homo erectus)
- Coincides with:
  - Smaller teeth, jaws
  - Smaller gut
  - Larger brain
  - Body size increase

**Mechanism:**
- Cooked food:
  - More digestible (nutrients available)
  - Kills pathogens
  - Detoxifies plants
  - Less chewing time needed

**Energy Budget:**
- Large brain expensive (20% of energy)
- Smaller gut (cooking = external digestion)
- Trade-off
- Cooking enables brain expansion

**Social:**
- Food sharing
- Division of labor (women gather/cook, men hunt)
- Pair bonding

**Critique:**
- Fire evidence ~400,000 years ago secure, not 1.9 mya
- Wrangham argues earlier evidence missed (poor preservation)
- Debated

**Other Explanations:**
- Meat-eating (without cooking)
- Tool use (processing)

---

## Language Origins

### The Hardest Problem

**Challenge:**
- Language doesn't fossilize
- No direct evidence
- Inference from anatomy, artifacts, genetics

---

## Anatomical Evidence

### Can They Speak?

**Vocal Tract:**
- Modern humans: descended larynx
- Allows wide range of sounds
- Newborns: high larynx (like chimps)
- Descends in childhood

**Fossil Evidence:**

**Hyoid Bone:**
- Horseshoe-shaped (neck)
- Supports tongue, larynx
- Neanderthal hyoid (Kebara, Israel)
  - Modern-looking
  - Suggests speech capability

**Skull Base:**
- Flexed (bent) in modern humans
- Related to larynx position
- Homo heidelbergensis: intermediate flexion
- Suggests descended larynx evolving

**Problem:**
- Anatomy ≠ language ability
- Chimps can't speak (anatomy)
- But: anatomy not sufficient (need brain)

**Brain:**
- Broca's area (speech production)
- Wernicke's area (comprehension)
- Asymmetry
- Endocasts (brain impressions in skull)
- Homo habilis: some asymmetry
- Homo erectus: more
- Neanderthals: human-like
- But: doesn't prove language (non-linguistic functions)

---

## Genetic Evidence

### FOXP2 Gene

**Discovery:**
- KE Family (London)
- Mutation in FOXP2
- Speech/language disorder

**Function:**
- Transcription factor (regulates other genes)
- Involved in language, motor control (speech)

**Evolution:**
- Humans unique variant (2 amino acid changes)
- When? ~300,000-400,000 years ago? (debated)

**Neanderthals:**
- Sequenced FOXP2
- **Same as modern humans!**
- Implication: language capable?

**Caution:**
- FOXP2 not "language gene"
- One of many
- Necessary, not sufficient

---

## Archaeological Proxies

### What Suggests Language?

**Symbolic Behavior:**
- Art, ornaments, burials
- Symbolic thought = language? (debated)
- Some argue symbolic thought requires language
- Others: can be symbolic without language

**Complex Tools:**
- Levallois (prepared-core)
- Multi-step process
- Teaching required
- Language aids teaching?

**Social Complexity:**
- Large groups
- Long-distance networks (exchange)
- Coordination (hunting drives)
- Language facilitates

**Innovation:**
- Cumulative culture
- "Ratchet effect" (Michael Tomasello)
- Build on previous generations
- Language transmits knowledge

---

## When Did Language Emerge?

### Hypotheses

**Early:**
- Homo habilis (~2.5 mya)
- Tool-making benefits from language
- Protolanguage (simple)

**Middle:**
- Homo erectus (~1.8 mya)
- Geographic expansion
- Acheulean hand axes (teaching?)

**Late:**
- Homo sapiens only (~300,000 years ago or later)
- Full modern language unique

**Neanderthals:**
- Capable? (FOXP2, hyoid suggest yes)
- Full language or limited?
- Debate continues

**Consensus:**
- Protolanguage earlier
- Full modern language Homo sapiens (maybe Neanderthals)
- ~300,000-50,000 years ago range

---

## Steven Mithen: Music Before Language?

**"Singing Neanderthals" (2005):**
- Music preceded language
- Hmmmmm: Holistic, Manipulative, Multi-modal, Musical, Mimetic
- Emotional communication
- Language evolved from musical proto-language

**Evidence:**
- Music ancient (flutes 40,000 years ago)
- Infants respond to music, prosody
- Universal (all cultures)

**Critique:**
- Speculative
- Hard to test

---

## Behavioral Modernity Synthesis

### What Makes Us Human?

**Traits:**

**Material Culture:**
- Blade technology
- Standardized, efficient
- Bone/antler/ivory tools
- Diverse toolkit

**Subsistence:**
- Broad-spectrum diet
- Fishing, fowling (not just big game)
- Food storage
- Scheduling

**Symbolic:**
- Art (cave, portable)
- Ornaments (beads, pendants)
- Notation (tallies?)
- Burials with goods

**Social:**
- Long-distance exchange (shells, exotic stone)
- Networks
- Large groups (beyond kin)
- Division of labor

**Cognition:**
- Abstract thought
- Planning (long-term)
- Innovation
- Cumulative culture

---

## When and Where?

**Africa First:**
- Blombos Cave (100,000-70,000 years ago)
- Middle Stone Age sophisticated
- Gradual accumulation

**Europe Later:**
- Upper Paleolithic (50,000-40,000 years ago)
- Dramatic (art explosion)
- Modern humans replace Neanderthals

**Not Sudden:**
- Mosaic
- Different traits appear at different times
- Not single "revolution"

**Neanderthals:**
- Some modern behaviors
- But: less elaborate
- Capable but different?

---

## Why Did It Happen?

### Theories

**Genetic Mutation:**
- Brain rewiring
- Richard Klein
- Language gene?
- Sudden capacity

**Population Size:**
- Demographic models
- Larger populations = more innovation
- Maintain innovations (don't lose)
- Adam Powell, others

**Social Networks:**
- Exchange, interaction
- Ideas spread
- Cumulative

**Climate Change:**
- Environmental pressure
- Adaptability favored
- Innovation

**Multivariate:**
- Probably all factors
- Gene-culture coevolution

---

## The "Great Leap Forward" Debate

**Term:**
- Jared Diamond (1992)
- ~50,000 years ago
- Sudden change

**Critique:**
- Eurocentric (ignores Africa)
- Not sudden
- Gradual in Africa

**Revised View:**
- No single leap
- Mosaic, gradual
- Africa leads
- Europe shows dramatic change (modern humans arrive)

---

## Out of Africa and Behavioral Modernity

**Timing:**
- Modern humans leave Africa ~70,000-60,000 years ago
- Already behaviorally modern? (Blombos suggests yes)
- Or: becomes modern after? (Klein argues)

**Rapid Spread:**
- Once behaviorally modern, explosive expansion
- Australia by ~65,000 years ago (maritime crossing!)
- Europe by ~45,000 years ago
- Americas by ~15,000+ years ago

**Advantage Over Neanderthals:**
- Modern humans replace Neanderthals (Europe)
- Why?
- Language? (full vs. limited)
- Technology? (blades, atlatl)
- Social networks?
- Slight advantages compound

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Did cooking drive human evolution?

**Question 2:** When did humans acquire full language?

**Question 3:** Could Neanderthals speak?

**Question 4:** Was behavioral modernity a "revolution" or gradual?

**Question 5:** What gave modern humans an edge over Neanderthals?

**Remember:** **Fire use** major transition warmth/cooking/light/protection/tools/social focal point. Archaeological evidence: early debated (Koobi Fora 1.5 mya/Swartkrans 1.0 mya natural?, Wonderwerk Cave 1.0 mya deep cave strong), secure 400,000+ years (Qesem/Zhoukoudian Peking Man, Neanderthals routine universal). Fire-making friction/percussion (flint + iron pyrite sparks), Neanderthals manganese dioxide lowers ignition. **Wrangham Cooking Hypothesis** (1.9 mya Homo erectus coincides smaller teeth/gut larger brain, cooked food more digestible external digestion energy budget trade-off, critique fire evidence only 400 kya secure). **Language origins** hardest problem doesn't fossilize. Anatomical: descended larynx vocal tract (Neanderthal hyoid Kebara modern, skull base flexion), brain Broca's/Wernicke's endocasts (asymmetry Homo habilis/erectus/Neanderthals human-like but doesn't prove). Genetic: **FOXP2 gene** (KE Family mutation speech disorder, humans unique variant 300-400 kya?, **Neanderthals SAME as modern humans** language capable?, caution not "language gene" necessary not sufficient). Archaeological proxies: symbolic behavior art/ornaments (requires language?), complex tools Levallois teaching, social complexity large groups networks coordination, innovation cumulative culture ratchet effect Tomasello. When emerged: early Homo habilis 2.5 mya protolanguage/middle Homo erectus 1.8 mya/late Homo sapiens 300 kya or later full modern, Neanderthals capable debated FOXP2/hyoid suggest yes but limited?, consensus protolanguage earlier full modern 300-50 kya. **Mithen music before language** "Singing Neanderthals" Hmmmmm emotional communication (flutes 40 kya ancient universal but speculative). **Behavioral modernity synthesis**: Material blade/bone diverse toolkit, subsistence broad-spectrum fishing, symbolic art/ornaments/burials, social exchange networks large groups, cognition abstract planning innovation cumulative culture. When/where **Africa first** (Blombos 100-70 kya Middle Stone Age gradual), Europe later (Upper Paleolithic 50-40 kya dramatic modern humans replace Neanderthals), **not sudden** mosaic different traits different times. Why: genetic mutation Klein brain rewiring/population size demographic Powell/social networks exchange/climate change pressure/multivariate gene-culture coevolution. "Great Leap Forward" debate (Diamond 50 kya sudden Eurocentric critique ignores Africa gradual revised no single leap Africa leads). Out of Africa 70-60 kya already modern Blombos?, rapid spread Australia 65 kya maritime Europe 45 kya Americas 15+ kya, advantage over Neanderthals language/technology/social slight compound. Understanding fire/language/behavioral modernity reveals becoming human gradual not sudden Africa first cooking/language/symbolism intertwined cultural takeoff.
