# Human Adaptation and Acclimatization: Climate and Body

---

## Adaptation vs. Acclimatization

### Two Ways to Adjust

**Adaptation:**
- Genetic, evolutionary
- Over generations
- Permanent (population level)
- Natural selection

**Acclimatization:**
- Individual, physiological
- Within lifetime
- Reversible
- Phenotypic plasticity

**Example:**
- **Adaptation**: Tibetans' genetic altitude adaptations
- **Acclimatization**: Lowlander visiting high altitude (produces more red blood cells)

## Skin Color

### The Most Visible Variation

**Range:**
- Very dark (equatorial Africa, Melanesia)
- Very light (Northern Europe)
- Gradient (cline) with latitude

**Melanin:**
- Pigment in skin
- Two types: eumelanin (brown-black), pheomelanin (red-yellow)
- Produced by melanocytes
- Amount determines color

---

## Why Skin Color Varies

### Balancing UV Radiation

**Two Pressures:**

**1. Folate Protection:**
- UV radiation breaks down folate (B vitamin)
- Folate essential for:
  - Fetal development (neural tube)
  - DNA synthesis
  - Sperm production
- **Dark skin protects folate**

**2. Vitamin D Synthesis:**
- UV radiation needed to produce vitamin D in skin
- Vitamin D essential for:
  - Calcium absorption
  - Bone health
  - Immune function
- **Light skin allows vitamin D synthesis**

**Balancing Act:**
- Too much UV → folate deficiency
- Too little UV → vitamin D deficiency
- Skin color optimized for local UV levels

**Nina Jablonski:**
- Leading researcher
- Mapped skin color to UV radiation
- Strong correlation
- "Living Color"

## Evolution of Skin Color

### Recent Changes

**Timeline:**

**6-7 mya:** Common ancestor with chimps
- Probably light-skinned under dark fur
- Like chimps today

**~1.2 mya:** Lose body hair (thermoregulation)
- Dark skin evolves (protect folate)
- Africa = high UV

**~100,000-70,000 years ago:** Leave Africa
- Migrate to lower UV environments
- Selection for lighter skin
- Recent! (evolutionarily)

**Multiple Losses:**
- Light skin evolved independently
- Europe, East Asia
- Different genes
- Convergent evolution

**Genes:**
- SLC24A5 (Europe)
- EDAR, KITLG (East Asia)
- Many genes involved
- Recent selection

---

## Problems with Using Skin Color for "Race"

**Issues:**

**1. Doesn't Correlate with Other Traits:**
- Dark Africans ≠ dark Melanesians genetically
- Convergent evolution
- Skin color doesn't predict genetics

**2. Continuous Variation:**
- No boundaries
- Gradients
- Where draw line?

**3. Recent:**
- Last 100,000 years
- Superficial
- Doesn't reflect deep ancestry

**4. Environmental:**
- Adaptive to UV levels
- Not innate "racial" essence

## Body Form and Climate

### Bergmann's and Allen's Rules

**Bergmann's Rule:**
- Larger bodies in cold climates
- Smaller in hot climates
- Why? Surface area to volume ratio
  - Large body: less surface per volume (conserves heat)
  - Small body: more surface per volume (dissipates heat)

**Allen's Rule:**
- Shorter limbs in cold
- Longer limbs in hot
- Why? Same principle
  - Short, compact (conserve heat)
  - Long, lanky (dissipate heat)

**Human Examples:**

**Cold Climates:**
- Inuit: compact, short limbs
- Northern Europeans: stockier

**Hot Climates:**
- Nilotic peoples (Sudan, Kenya): very tall, long limbs
- Masai, Dinka, Nuer

**Nasal Shape:**
- Narrow nose: cold, dry climates (warm, humidify air)
- Wide nose: hot, humid climates (cool air)

## High Altitude Adaptation

### Three Populations, Three Solutions

**Challenges:**
- Low oxygen (hypoxia)
- Breathing difficult
- Altitude sickness
- Lower birth weight

**1. Tibetan Plateau (3,000-5,000 m):**

**Adaptations:**
- Low hemoglobin (counterintuitive!)
- High oxygen saturation
- Increased blood flow
- Wide arteries
- EPAS1 gene (from Denisovans!)
- NO (nitric oxide) helps

**Cynthia Beall:**
- Leading researcher
- Tibetan adaptations
- Evolved over thousands of years

**2. Andean Highlands (Peru, Bolivia):**

**Different Strategy:**
- High hemoglobin (more red blood cells)
- Large chest capacity
- Chronic mountain sickness (some)

**3. East African Highlands (Ethiopia):**

**Yet Another Way:**
- Intermediate approach
- High oxygen saturation
- Not extreme hemoglobin
- Recent settlement (< Tibetans, Andeans)

**Convergent Evolution:**
- Three populations
- Independent adaptations
- Different genetic pathways
- Same problem, different solutions

---

## Heat Adaptations

### Staying Cool

**Sweating:**
- Humans = champion sweaters
- Eccrine glands (all over body)
- Evaporative cooling
- Need water

**Hairlessness:**
- Lost body hair ~1.2 mya
- Allows sweating
- Thermoregulation
- "Aquatic ape" hypothesis (rejected)
- Savanna running hypothesis (more likely)

**Body Shape:**
- Tall, thin (Nilotic peoples)
- Maximize surface area
- Heat dissipation

---

## Cold Adaptations

### Staying Warm

**Body Shape:**
- Compact (Inuit, Arctic peoples)
- Minimize surface area
- Conserve heat

**Subcutaneous Fat:**
- Insulation
- Stores energy

**Metabolic:**
- Basal metabolic rate higher?
- Debated
- Inuit traditional diet (high fat)

**Behavioral/Cultural:**
- Clothing!
- Shelter
- Fire
- Technology > biology

---

## Desert Adaptations

### Extreme Aridity

**Challenges:**
- Heat
- Dehydration
- Sun exposure

**Tuareg, Bedouin:**
- Clothing (covers body, traps air)
- Light colors (reflect sun)
- Behavioral (rest in heat of day)

**!Kung (Kalahari):**
- Water conservation (urine concentrated)
- Behavioral (efficient foraging)

---

## Lactase Persistence

### Dairy Adaptation

**Most Mammals:**
- Stop producing lactase (enzyme) after weaning
- Can't digest lactose (milk sugar)
- Lactose intolerance

**Some Humans:**
- Lactase persistence
- Can digest milk as adults
- Genetic mutation

**Where:**
- Northern Europe (70-90%)
- East African pastoralists (some)
- Central Asian
- Independent mutations

**Why:**
- Dairy farming (last 10,000 years)
- Nutritional advantage
- Strong selection

**Cultural Evolution:**
- Niche construction
- Humans created environment
- Genes responded
- Gene-culture coevolution

---

## Malaria Resistance

### Genetic Adaptations

**Malaria:**
- Parasitic disease
- Plasmodium
- Mosquito-borne
- Major killer (historically)

**Genetic Defenses:**

**Sickle Cell (HbS):**
- One copy = malaria resistance
- Two copies = sickle cell disease
- Balanced polymorphism
- Heterozygote advantage

**Thalassemia:**
- Mediterranean, Southeast Asia
- Reduced hemoglobin
- Malaria resistance

**G6PD Deficiency:**
- Enzyme deficiency
- Malaria resistance
- Africa, Mediterranean, Asia

**Duffy Antigen:**
- Receptor for malaria
- Mutation prevents infection
- West Africa

**Geographic Distribution:**
- Where malaria is/was endemic
- NOT racial
- Environmental, historical

---

## Skin Cancer

### UV Radiation Costs

**Risk:**
- Lighter skin = higher skin cancer risk
- UV damages DNA
- Melanoma

**But:**
- Usually occurs after reproductive age
- Weak selection against

**Folate:**
- More important (reproductive success)
- Drives dark skin in tropics

---

## Acclimatization Examples

### Individual Adjustments

**Heat:**
- Increased sweating
- Plasma volume expansion
- Takes ~2 weeks

**Cold:**
- Peripheral vasoconstriction (reduce blood flow to skin)
- Shivering
- Increased metabolism

**Altitude:**
- Increased red blood cells
- Increased breathing
- Takes weeks-months
- Not as effective as genetic adaptation

**Developmental:**
- Children growing up at altitude
- Larger chest capacity
- More permanent
- "Developmental acclimatization"

---

## Phenotypic Plasticity

### Flexible Responses

**Examples:**

**Stature:**
- Nutrition affects height
- Not just genetics
- Secular trend (populations getting taller)
- Better nutrition

**Obesity:**
- "Thrifty gene" hypothesis (Neel)
  - Genes for fat storage
  - Adaptive in feast/famine
  - Maladaptive in modern plenty
  - Controversial, debated

**Developmental Plasticity:**
- Critical periods
- Environment shapes development
- Barker hypothesis (fetal origins)
  - In utero conditions affect adult health
  - Low birth weight → heart disease

---

## Epigenetics

### Beyond DNA Sequence

**Epigenetics:**
- Gene expression changes
- Not DNA sequence changes
- Methylation, histone modification
- Can be inherited (sometimes)

**Famine Studies:**
- Dutch Hunger Winter (WWII)
- Children of pregnant women
- Epigenetic changes
- Transmitted to grandchildren

**Implications:**
- Environment affects genes
- Inheritance beyond DNA
- "Lamarckian" element

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is human biological evolution over (technology buffers), or ongoing?

**Question 2:** Should we genetically engineer altitude/heat tolerance?

**Question 3:** Do adaptations to past environments harm us today (thrifty genes)?

**Question 4:** Can we separate biological from social/economic causes of health disparities?

**Question 5:** How does knowing adaptation is environmental, not racial, change perspective?

**Remember:** Adaptation (genetic, evolutionary) vs. acclimatization (individual, reversible). Skin color varies due to UV radiation—dark skin protects folate, light skin allows vitamin D synthesis (Jablonski). Evolved recently (last 100,000 years), multiple times independently, doesn't correlate with other traits. Bergmann's rule (larger bodies in cold) and Allen's rule (shorter limbs in cold) explain body form variation. High altitude adaptations differ: Tibetans (low hemoglobin, EPAS1 from Denisovans), Andeans (high hemoglobin), Ethiopians (intermediate)—convergent evolution. Heat adaptations (sweating, hairlessness, tall thin bodies), cold adaptations (compact, fat). Lactase persistence (dairy farming, gene-culture coevolution). Malaria resistance (sickle cell, thalassemia, geographic not racial). Acclimatization (heat, cold, altitude) within lifetime. Phenotypic plasticity, epigenetics. Understanding adaptation reveals human variation is environmental response, recent, superficial—doesn't support race, shows humans remarkably adaptable.
