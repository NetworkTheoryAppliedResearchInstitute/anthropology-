# Contemporary Spirituality: Secularism, New Age, and Religious Change

---

## Religion in the Modern World

**Classic Secularization Thesis:**
- Modernity → decline of religion
- Science, rationality replace faith
- Religion privatized, marginalized
- Weber's "disenchantment"

**Reality:**
- Religion persists, transforms
- New forms emerge
- "Spiritual but not religious"
- Fundamentalisms rise
- Secularization uneven

**Anthropology Shows:**
- Religion adapts to modernity
- Not disappearing
- Changing forms
- Global variety

## Secularism and Secularization

### Defining Terms

**Secularization:**
- Process: religion's declining social significance
- Institutional differentiation (religion from politics, education, etc.)
- Privatization
- Variable (Europe ≠ US ≠ Middle East)

**Secularism:**
- Political ideology
- Separation of church and state
- State neutrality toward religion
- Modern Western origin

**Secular:**
- Non-religious
- Worldly, temporal
- But culturally specific category

### Talal Asad: "Formations of the Secular" (2003)

**Key Argument:**
- "Secular" is not universal
- Product of specific Christian history
- Exported globally
- Imposes particular configuration

**Modern Secular:**
- Religion separated from politics, science, economics
- Privatized to individual belief
- This separation itself Christian/Western

**Colonial Imposition:**
- Colonizers brought secularism
- Reorganized religious life
- Created "religion" as category

**Implications:**
- Can't assume "secular" neutral
- Shapes what counts as "religion"
- Power in categorization

### Varieties of Secularism

**France (Laïcité):**
- Strict separation
- Ban religious symbols (schools, public)
- Headscarf controversies
- Secular as ideology

**United States:**
- Church-state separation
- But "In God We Trust"
- Public religion
- Christian nationalism debates

**India:**
- Secular state
- But accommodates religious laws
- Communal tensions
- Hindu nationalism challenges

**Turkey:**
- Kemalist secularism (20th century)
- Recent re-Islamization
- Contested

**China:**
- State atheism (officially)
- Religious revival
- State control

**Insight:** Secularism not one thing—multiple forms, political projects.

### Anthropology of Secularism

**Studying the Secular:**
- Not absence of religion
- Particular arrangement
- Produces categories

**Saba Mahmood, "Religious Difference in a Secular Age" (2016):**
- Minority religions in secular states
- Secular = Christian normativity
- "Good religion" vs. "bad religion"

**Example: Egyptian Copts:**
- Minority Christians
- Secular state supposedly neutral
- But favors Muslim majority
- Violence against Copts

**Anthropologists Show:**
- Secular not neutral
- Embedded in power
- Minoritizes some religions

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Is "spiritual but not religious" meaningful, or cop-out?

**Question 2:** Can secular states truly be neutral toward religion?

**Question 3:** Is cultural appropriation wrong, or cultural exchange?

**Question 4:** Does Pentecostalism empower or exploit?

**Question 5:** Can mindfulness be separated from Buddhism without losing something essential?

**Ethnographic:**
- African Religions ([[african_religions.md]])
- Syncretic Religions ([[syncretic_religions.md]])

**Classic Texts:**

**Remember:** Religion isn't declining—it's transforming. Secularism is not neutral but particular political arrangement (Asad). "Spiritual but not religious" grows, mixing practices eclectically, often commodified. New Age movements appropriate from diverse traditions, creating spiritual marketplace. Neopaganism and Wicca revive (or invent) nature religions. Global Pentecostalism explodes, offering healing, community, prosperity. Islamic revival shows piety as agency, challenging Western assumptions. Mindfulness secularizes Buddhism, for better and worse. Understanding contemporary religion reveals ongoing vitality, adaptation, power struggles, and human creativity—religion remains central to navigating modernity, not relic of past.
