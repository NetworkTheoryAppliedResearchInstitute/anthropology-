# Asian Archaeological Sequences: From Indus to East Asia

---

## Indus Valley Civilization (~2,600-1,900 BCE)

### Harappan Culture

**Geographic Extent:**
- Pakistan, northwest India
- Indus River and tributaries
- Over 1,000 sites
- Larger than Egypt or Mesopotamia

**Major Cities:**

### Harappa
- Punjab (Pakistan)
- Excavated 1920s+
- John Marshall, Mortimer Wheeler

### Mohenjo-daro
- Sindh (Pakistan)
- "Mound of the Dead"
- Best preserved
- Excavated 1920s+

---

## Urban Planning (Remarkable!)

**Grid Layout:**
- Planned streets (right angles)
- Standardized city blocks

**Standardized Bricks:**
- Fired bricks (ratio 4:2:1)
- Uniform across all sites
- Suggests central authority or shared cultural norms

**Infrastructure:**

**Drainage:**
- Sophisticated
- Covered drains
- Connected houses to street drains
- Sanitation advanced

**Wells:**
- Public, private
- Clean water access

**Great Bath (Mohenjo-daro):**
- Large pool (~12m × 7m)
- Waterproof (bitumen)
- Steps, changing rooms
- Ritual bathing?

**Granaries:**
- Large structures
- Centralized storage?
- Or: platforms for elite residences? (debated)

---

## Material Culture

**Weights and Measures:**
- Standardized
- Binary, decimal
- Trade regulation

**Seals:**
- Steatite (stone)
- Square (~2-3 cm)
- Animal motifs (unicorn, bull, elephant, tiger)
- Indus script (short inscriptions)
- Administrative? Trade? Ownership?

**Pottery:**
- Wheel-made
- Red, black painting
- Standardized forms

**Crafts:**
- Carnelian beads
- Shell bangles
- Bronze tools, weapons
- Cotton textiles (earliest evidence)

---

## Economy

**Agriculture:**
- Wheat, barley
- Cotton
- Dates, melons
- Cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats

**Trade:**
- **Long-distance:**
  - Mesopotamia (Persian Gulf route)
  - Central Asia (lapis lazuli, Afghanistan)
  - South India (gold)
- Indus seals found in Mesopotamia
- Mesopotamian texts mention "Meluhha" (Indus?)

---

## Society (Puzzling!)

**Egalitarian?**
- Less clear evidence of inequality (vs. Egypt, Mesopotamia)
- **No palaces identified**
- **No royal tombs** (with rich grave goods)
- Houses varied size but not extreme

**But:**
- Citadels (raised platforms, some sites)
- Larger buildings (elite residences? Assembly halls?)
- Sanitation differences (some houses, not all)

**Debate:**
- Merchant oligarchy?
- Theocratic?
- Heterarchical (multiple power centers)?

---

## Indus Script

**Characteristics:**
- ~400 signs
- Short inscriptions (average 5 signs, max ~26)
- Right-to-left (usually)
- Seals, pottery, copper tablets

**Undeciphered:**
- Language unknown
- No bilingual texts (Rosetta Stone equivalent)
- Harappan language?
  - Dravidian? (South Indian languages)
  - Indo-European?
  - Isolated language?

**Debate:**
- Is it even writing? (or symbols?)
- Most accept it's writing (too complex for symbols)
- Decipherment attempts many, none accepted

---

## Decline and Collapse (~1,900 BCE)

**Evidence:**
- Cities abandoned
- Urban phase ends
- Post-Harappan: villages, simpler

**Theories:**

**Climate Change:**
- Drying (monsoon weakening)
- River changes (Ghaggar-Hakra dried up?)
- Agricultural stress

**River Shifts:**
- Indus, tributaries changed course
- Floods or drought

**Aryan Invasion? (Outdated):**
- 19th-20th C theory
- Indo-Aryans invade, destroy
- **Rejected:** No invasion evidence
- Decline internal, gradual

**Multivariate:**
- Climate + hydrology + trade disruption
- Gradual, not catastrophic
- Population dispersed (eastward, southward)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Why is the Indus script still undeciphered?

**Question 2:** Why was the Indus Valley civilization more "egalitarian"?

**Question 3:** How did China develop such continuity (vs. Mesopotamia, Egypt)?

**Question 4:** Did rice agriculture enable Southeast Asian complexity?

**Question 5:** Why did Japan resist agriculture for so long (Jōmon)?
