# Modern Human Origins: Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Us

---

## When Did Modern Humans Appear?

### Defining "Anatomically Modern"

**Homo sapiens:**
- Our species
- "Wise human"

**Anatomically Modern Features:**
- High, rounded skull
- Flat face (not protruding)
- Small brow ridges
- **Chin** (unique to us!)
- Gracile skeleton
- Brain: ~1350 cc average (but range 1000-2000 cc)

**When:**
- ~300,000 years ago (earliest fossils)
- But: behavioral modernity later

**Where:**
- Africa (origin)
- Then: global expansion

## Early Homo sapiens in Africa

### African Origins

**Jebel Irhoud (Morocco, ~315,000 years ago):**
- Jean-Jacques Hublin, 2017
- Pushed back modern human origins
- Mix: modern face, archaic skull shape
- Tools: Middle Stone Age

**Omo Kibish (Ethiopia, ~195,000 years ago):**
- Oldest clearly modern fossils
- Omo I: modern
- Omo II: more archaic

**Herto (Ethiopia, ~160,000 years ago):**
- Modern anatomy
- "Homo sapiens idaltu" (subspecies?)

**Implications:**
- Modern humans emerged in Africa
- Over long period (300,000+ years)
- Not sudden

---

## Out of Africa

### Global Expansion

**Recent African Origin Model:**
- Modern humans originated in Africa
- Migrated out ~70,000-60,000 years ago
- Replaced other hominins (Neanderthals, etc.)
- **This is now consensus**

**Evidence:**
- Genetic diversity (highest in Africa)
- Fossils (oldest in Africa)
- Ancient DNA

**Alternative (Discredited):**
- **Multiregional Evolution**
  - Milford Wolpoff
  - Modern humans evolved separately in different regions
  - Gene flow maintained one species
  - **Rejected:** Ancient DNA shows Out of Africa correct

## Migration Routes and Timing

### How Did Humans Spread?

**Southern Route:**
- Horn of Africa → Arabian Peninsula
- ~70,000-60,000 years ago
- Coastal route
- Reached Australia by ~65,000 years ago

**Northern Routes:**
- Later
- Europe, North Asia

**Timeline:**

**~70,000 years ago:** Leave Africa
**~65,000 years ago:** Australia (maritime crossing!)
**~45,000 years ago:** Europe
**~40,000 years ago:** Siberia
**~15,000 years ago:** Americas (debated, maybe earlier)
**~3,000 years ago:** Remote Pacific islands

**Bottleneck:**
- Toba supervolcano eruption (~74,000 years ago)
- Nearly wiped out humans?
- Genetic bottleneck (low diversity)
- Debated how severe

## Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis)

### Our Closest Extinct Relatives

**Discovery:**
- Neander Valley, Germany (1856)
- First fossil hominin recognized

**When:**
- ~400,000-40,000 years ago
- Europe, Western Asia

**Anatomy:**
- Robust, stocky build
- Large nose
- Heavy brow ridges
- Chinless
- Brain: 1200-1750 cc (actually larger than ours!)
- Short limbs (cold adaptation)

**Adaptations:**
- Cold climate (Ice Age Europe)
- Bergmann's and Allen's rules
- Stocky = less heat loss

**Behavior:**

**Sophisticated:**
- Mousterian tools (Middle Paleolithic)
- Fire use
- Hunted large game
- Lived in caves, rock shelters
- Cared for injured (compassion)
- Buried dead (flowers at Shanidar?)
- Pigments, ornaments (symbolic?)

**Debated:**
- Language? (hyoid bone suggests yes)
- Art? (some caves, debated)
- Symbolic thought?

**"Dumb Brute" Stereotype:**
- 19th/20th century
- Racism, evolutionary prejudice
- Now: recognized as sophisticated

## Neanderthal-Human Interaction

### Did We Interbreed?

**2010: Neanderthal Genome (Svante Pääbo):**
- Sequenced Neanderthal DNA
- Ancient DNA from bones

**SHOCKING Discovery:**
- Non-African humans have ~2% Neanderthal DNA
- Africans: 0% (or very little)

**Implications:**
- Interbreeding occurred
- ~50,000-60,000 years ago
- Middle East (first contact)
- Hybridization, not total replacement

**What Neanderthal DNA Does:**
- Immune system genes
- Skin, hair traits
- Disease susceptibility
- Altitude adaptation (Tibet)

**Social Implications:**
- Were Neanderthals "human"?
- "Cousin" species
- Reproductive compatibility

---

## Neanderthal Extinction

### Why Did They Disappear?

**Last Neanderthals:**
- ~40,000 years ago
- Iberian refugia (Gibraltar)

**Theories:**

**1. Competition:**
- Modern humans outcompeted
- Better tools, strategies
- Wider social networks

**2. Climate Change:**
- Ice Age fluctuations
- Habitat loss

**3. Assimilation:**
- Interbreeding
- Absorbed into human populations
- (But only ~2% DNA)

**4. Disease:**
- Humans brought pathogens?

**5. Small Population:**
- Inbreeding depression
- Low genetic diversity
- Vulnerable to shocks

**Likely: Combination**

**Not "Inferior":**
- Survived hundreds of thousands of years
- Adapted successfully
- Just unlucky?

## Denisovans

### Mystery Hominin

**Discovery:**
- Denisova Cave, Siberia
- 2010
- Finger bone, teeth

**No Complete Skeleton:**
- Only fragments
- Mostly known from DNA!

**DNA:**
- Sister group to Neanderthals
- Split ~400,000 years ago
- Distinct species/subspecies

**Range:**
- Asia (Siberia to Southeast Asia)
- High altitude (Tibetan Plateau)

**Interbreeding:**
- Modern humans interbred
- Melanesians, Australians: ~5% Denisovan DNA
- Tibetans: EPAS1 gene (altitude adaptation) from Denisovans

**Mysterious:**
- What did they look like?
- 2019: Reconstruction from DNA (methylation)
- Broad face, large teeth

---

## Other Archaic Hominins?

### "Ghost" Populations

**Africa:**
- Ancient DNA suggests archaic admixture
- Unknown hominin species?
- "Ghost lineages"

**Evidence:**
- Genetic diversity
- Deep branches

**Possibilities:**
- Homo naledi?
- Other unknown species

---

## Interbreeding Summary

### Complex Picture

**Not Simple Replacement:**
- Modern humans interbred with:
  - Neanderthals (2% in non-Africans)
  - Denisovans (up to 5% in some)
  - Unknown archaics (Africa)

**Multiregional Element:**
- Some gene flow
- But: mostly replacement
- "Leaky replacement"

**Implications:**
- "Human" = fuzzy boundary
- We're hybrids
- Neanderthals, Denisovans part of us

---

## Behavioral Modernity

### When Did We Become "Us"?

**Anatomical Modernity ≠ Behavioral Modernity:**
- Modern anatomy ~300,000 years ago
- Modern behavior later

**Upper Paleolithic Revolution (Europe, ~40,000 years ago):**
- Blade tools
- Art (cave paintings, sculptures)
- Music (flutes)
- Elaborate burials
- Figurines ("Venus" figurines)
- Symbolic explosion

**But:**

**Africa Earlier:**
- Blombos Cave (South Africa, ~100,000-70,000 years ago)
  - Ochre engravings (abstract patterns)
  - Shell beads
  - Symbolic behavior earlier

**Gradual, Not Sudden:**
- Not "human revolution"
- Accumulated innovations
- In/out of Africa multiple times?

---

## Cognitive Evolution

### What Changed Mentally?

**Language:**
- Full modern language when?
- FOXP2 gene (speech, language)
- Neanderthals had modern FOXP2
- Symbolic thought requires language

**Theory of Mind:**
- Understanding others' minds
- Essential for complex society
- When did it emerge?

**Art and Symbolism:**
- Cave art (Lascaux, Chauvet, Altamira)
- Music, dance
- Religion?
- Ritual burials

**Cumulative Culture:**
- Build on previous generations
- Ratchet effect
- Unique to humans (degree)

---

## Modern Human Success

### Why Did We Survive?

**Compared to Neanderthals, Other Hominins:**

**Possible Advantages:**
- Better technology
- Language (if unique)
- Larger social networks
- Innovation, adaptability
- Trade networks (artifacts travel far)
- Division of labor
- Symbolic culture
- Cumulative culture

**But:**
- Neanderthals had culture too
- Not "primitive"
- Small differences compounded?

**Luck:**
- Right place, right time
- Climate changes
- Population size

---

## Race and Human Variation

### Minimal Biological Differences

**"Races" Not Real Biologically:**
- Genetic variation mostly within groups
- Not between
- Lewontin's 85/15 rule
- Continuous variation (clinal)

**Skin Color:**
- Adaptation to UV radiation
- Vitamin D synthesis
- Folate protection
- Recent (last 100,000 years)

**See:** [[../variation/race_concept_critique.md]]

---

## Recent Evolution

### Humans Still Evolving

**Last 10,000 Years:**
- Agriculture
- Dairy farming (lactase persistence)
- Disease resistance
- High altitude (Tibet, Andes)

**Ongoing:**
- Evolution continues
- Natural selection
- Drift
- Gene flow (globalization)

**But:**
- Culture buffers biology
- Technology, medicine
- Complex interaction

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** If Neanderthals and Denisovans were "human," what does that mean for ethics?

**Question 2:** Should we try to "resurrect" Neanderthals (cloning)?

**Question 3:** What made modern humans "successful" and others extinct?

**Question 4:** Are we still evolving, or has culture stopped evolution?

**Question 5:** Does knowing we're all African change how we think about race?

**Remember:** Anatomically modern Homo sapiens emerged in Africa ~300,000 years ago (Jebel Irhoud, Omo, Herto). Out of Africa ~70,000-60,000 years ago, global expansion (Australia 65 kya, Europe 45 kya, Americas ~15 kya). Recent African Origin model now consensus. Neanderthals (400-40 kya) were sophisticated (tools, burial, care for injured, large brains). Neanderthal genome 2010 showed interbreeding—non-Africans ~2% Neanderthal DNA. Denisovans known mostly from DNA, interbred with ancestors of Melanesians/Australians. Complex picture: mostly replacement but some interbreeding ("leaky replacement"). Behavioral modernity gradual, not sudden (Blombos Cave art 100 kya, Upper Paleolithic 40 kya). Language, symbolic thought, cumulative culture key to modern human success. Race not biologically real—minimal genetic differences, recent adaptations. Humans still evolving. Understanding modern human origins reveals we're all recent Africans, related to extinct hominins, success due to culture and perhaps luck.
