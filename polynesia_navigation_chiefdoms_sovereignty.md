---

## Polynesia: Geographic and Cultural Overview

### The Triangle

**Boundaries:**
- Vertices: Hawaii (north), Easter Island/Rapa Nui (east), New Zealand/Aotearoa (southwest)
- Vast ocean area (~10 million sq mi)
- Scattered islands

**Major Island Groups:**
- Hawaii
- Samoa
- Tonga
- Tahiti (French Polynesia)
- Cook Islands
- New Zealand (Māori)
- Easter Island (Rapa Nui)
- Marquesas
- Tuvalu

**Shared Features:**

---

## Settlement and Navigation

### Voyaging

**Settlement:**
- Austronesian expansion (3,500+ years ago, Taiwan → Pacific)
- Reached Remote Oceania (~3,000 years ago)
- **Last major human migration** (except Antarctica, Arctic)
- Hawaii (~1,200-1,500 CE)
- New Zealand (~1250-1300 CE, latest)
- Easter Island (~1200 CE)

**Navigation:**
- Double-hulled canoes (voyaging canoes)
- No instruments (no compasses, sextants)
- **Wayfinding:**
  - Stars (rising/setting positions)
  - Swells, waves (ocean patterns)
  - Birds (land indicators)
  - Winds
  - Clouds (over islands)

**Mau Piailug:**
- Master navigator (Micronesia, Satawal)
- Taught Hawaiians (navigation revived, 20th C)
- **Hōkūleʻa** (Hawaiian voyaging canoe, 1975+)
  - Traditional navigation (Hawaii → Tahiti, 1976, successful)
  - Cultural revival

**Ben Finney:**
- Anthropologist (experimental archaeology)
- Tested Polynesian navigation (voyaging experiments)

---

## Chiefdoms

### Hierarchy

**Contrast: Melanesia:**
- Melanesia: Big men (achieved status, egalitarian-ish)
- Polynesia: Chiefs (hereditary, hierarchical)

**Marshall Sahlins:**
- *"Poor Man, Rich Man, Big-Man, Chief"* (1963) - see Melanesia
- Chiefs: Inherited status, coercive power, permanent

**Features:**
- Ranked society (chiefs, nobles, commoners)
- Hereditary leadership (primogeniture often)
- Tribute (commoners → chiefs)
- Redistribution (chiefs organize, but keep surplus)
- Warfare (conquest, expansion, some)

---

## Mana and Tapu

### Sacred Power

**Mana:**
- Spiritual power, efficacy, prestige
- Possessed by chiefs (high mana)
- Hereditary (concentrated in chiefly lines)
- Can increase/decrease (actions, success)

**Tapu (Taboo):**
- Sacred prohibition
- Chiefs = highly tapu (dangerous, sacred)
- Rules: Avoid contact, separate eating, etc.
- Violation = dangerous (spiritual harm)

**Relationship:**
- Mana and tapu = linked (high mana → high tapu)
- Maintain social hierarchy (ritual separation)

---

## Hawaii

### Complex Chiefdoms

**Pre-Contact:**
- Multiple chiefdoms (islands, competing)
- Warfare (unification attempts)

**Kamehameha I:**
- United Hawaiian Islands (1810)
- Kingdom of Hawaii (established)

**Social Structure:**
- *Aliʻi* (chiefs, nobility)
- *Kapu* (tapu, strict system)
- *Makaʻāinana* (commoners)
- *Kauā* (outcasts, untouchables)

**European Contact:**
- Captain James Cook (1778, killed 1779, Hawaii)
- Missionaries (1820+, Congregationalist)
  - Conversion (Christianity)
  - Literacy (Hawaiian written)

**Overthrow:**
- 1893: US businessmen overthrow Queen Liliʻuokalani (sugar planters)
- 1898: US annexation
- 1959: US statehood

**Contemporary:**
- Sovereignty movement (Native Hawaiian)
- Apology Resolution (1993, US Congress, acknowledged illegal overthrow)
- Debates: Independence, reparations, land rights

---

## Samoa

### "Fa'a Samoa" (Samoan Way)

**Social Organization:**
- *Matai* system (chiefs, family heads)
- *Fono* (council of matai, village governance)
- *Aiga* (extended family)

**Colonialism:**
- Germany (Western Samoa, 1900-1914)
- New Zealand (1914-1962, Western Samoa)
- US (American Samoa, 1900-present, territory)

**Independence:**
- Western Samoa (1962, first Polynesian nation independence)
- Now: Samoa (dropped "Western," 1997)
- American Samoa: Still US territory

**Margaret Mead:**
- *Coming of Age in Samoa* (1928)
  - Based on fieldwork (1925-1926, American Samoa)
  - Argument: Adolescence not inherently stressful (cultural, nurture vs. nature)
    - Samoan teens: Relaxed, free sexuality, no "storm and stress"
  - Controversial:
    - **Derek Freeman:** *Margaret Mead and Samoa* (1983)
      - Critiqued Mead (misrepresented Samoa)
      - Claimed informants lied, Mead misunderstood
      - Bitter debate (Freeman vs. defenders)
    - Ongoing: Most anthropologists = Mead had valid points, Freeman overstated
  - Importance: Popularized anthropology (best-seller), culture-nature debates

---

## Tonga

### Kingdom

**Unique:**
- Never colonized (only Pacific nation)
- Monarchy (still, constitutional)

**Social Structure:**
- King, nobles, commoners (ranked)
- Hereditary chiefs

**Influence:**
- **Mariner Captivity:**
  - William Mariner (British sailor, lived Tonga 1806-1810, as tabu-imposed companion of chief)
  - Account (detailed ethnography, published 1817)
  - Early Polynesian ethnography

---

## Māori (New Zealand/Aotearoa)

### Settlement

**Arrival:**
- ~1250-1300 CE (Polynesian voyagers)
- Settled Aotearoa (New Zealand)

**Pre-Contact:**
- Horticulture (sweet potato, *kumara*)
- Warfare (common, fortified villages, *pā*)
- Carving (wood, *whakairo*)
- Woven cloaks (*kākahu*)

---

## European Contact and Colonization

### British Colony

**Contact:**
- Captain James Cook (1769)
- Whalers, traders, missionaries (early 19th C)

**Treaty of Waitangi (1840):**
- Māori chiefs, British Crown
- British sovereignty (British version)
- Māori version: Partnership, chiefs retain authority (*rangatiratanga*)
- **Mistranslation** (deliberate or not, debated)
  - English: Māori cede sovereignty
  - Māori: Chiefs retain authority
- Foundation of British colony

**Land Wars (1845-1872):**
- Māori resistance (British land confiscation)
- Some victories (Māori), ultimately British control

**Land Loss:**
- 90% Māori land lost (by 1900)
- Mechanisms: War, confiscation, sale, legal manipulation

---

## Māori Renaissance

### Cultural Revival

**1970s+:**
- Māori activism (land rights, language, culture)
- **Waitangi Tribunal (1975):**
  - Investigate Treaty breaches
  - Compensation, land return (some)

**Language Revitalization:**
- **Te Kōhanga Reo** ("Language Nests," 1982+)
  - Immersion preschools (Māori-only)
  - Model for indigenous language revival worldwide (see Phase 5)
- Māori-medium schools (*Kura Kaupapa Māori*)
- Te Reo Māori (official language, 1987)

**Anthropological Work:**

---

## Tahiti and French Polynesia

### French Colonialism

**Colonization:**
- France (1880, protectorate; 1946, overseas territory)

**Nuclear Testing:**
- Moruroa Atoll (1966-1996)
  - French nuclear tests (~200 tests)
  - Environmental damage
  - Health impacts (radiation)
  - Protests (international, Polynesian)

**Contemporary:**
- French overseas collectivity (special status)
- Independence movement (weak, tourism-dependent economy)

---

## Easter Island (Rapa Nui)

### Moai and Collapse

**Famous For:**
- **Moai** (giant stone statues, ~900 statues)
- Carved (volcanic tuff, 13-20 feet tall typically, some 30+ feet)
- Transported (rolled, sleds?, debated)

**Settlement:**
- ~1200 CE (Polynesian voyagers)

**"Collapse":**
- **Jared Diamond:** *Collapse* (2005)
  - Easter Island = cautionary tale (ecological collapse)
  - Deforestation (trees cut for moai transport, agriculture)
  - Environmental degradation → societal collapse
  - Population crash (civil war, starvation)
  - **Ecocide** (self-destruction)

**Critiques:**
- **Terry Hunt, Carl Lipo:** Alternative
  - Collapse = exaggerated
  - Deforestation = rats (ate palm seeds), not just humans
  - Population: Lower than Diamond claims
  - Decline = European contact (disease, slavery)
- Ongoing debate (collapse vs. contact)

**Chilean Annexation:**
- Chile (1888, annexed)
- Rapa Nui people = Chilean citizens
- Land rights struggles

---

## Contemporary Pacific Issues

### Sovereignty and Self-Determination

**Decolonization:**
- Most Polynesian islands now independent or self-governing
- Exceptions: American Samoa (US), French Polynesia (France), others

**Nuclear Legacy:**
- French Polynesia (Moruroa tests, see above)
- Marshall Islands (US tests, 1946-1958, Bikini Atoll, ~67 tests)
  - Displaced populations
  - Health impacts (radiation, cancers)
  - Compensation (inadequate, ongoing claims)

**Climate Change:**
- Sea level rise (existential threat, low atolls)
- Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands (especially vulnerable)
- Possible displacement (entire nations)
- "Climate refugees" (future)

**Migration:**
- To metropolitan powers (US, New Zealand, Australia)
- Remittances (major income source)
- Diaspora (larger than home populations, some)

---

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** How did Polynesians navigate thousands of miles without instruments?

**Question 2:** Was Margaret Mead right or wrong about Samoa?

**Question 3:** What does the Treaty of Waitangi mean: Partnership or British sovereignty?

**Question 4:** Did Easter Island collapse ecologically or from European contact?

**Question 5:** What happens to island nations disappearing under the sea (climate change)?
