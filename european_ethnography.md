# European Ethnography: Anthropology "At Home" and the Study of the West

---

## Introduction: Why Anthropology in Europe?

**Irony:**
- Anthropology invented in Europe
- To study "Others" (colonized peoples)
- Europe itself rarely the "field"

**Why Study Europe Anthropologically?**

**Early Excuse:** "We already know Europe" (history, sociology study it)

**Shift (Mid-20th Century):**
- Peasant studies (Mediterranean, Eastern Europe)
- Applied anthropology (development, post-war reconstruction)
- Recognition: Europe is culturally diverse, not monolithic

**"Anthropology at Home" (1970s+):**
- Study own society anthropologically
- Reflexivity: What do we take for granted?
- Defamiliarization: Make the familiar strange

**Contemporary:**
- Europe = legitimate field site
- Immigration, multiculturalism
- EU integration, nationalism
- Post-socialism
- Anthropology of European modernity

## Challenges of European Anthropology

### The "Heimat" Problem

**Heimat** (German: homeland):
- Familiarity breeds invisibility
- Hard to defamiliarize what you assume is "normal"
- Western anthropologists default to their own worldview

**Solutions:**
- Comparative method (compare European societies)
- Historical depth
- Study subcultures, margins (not just dominant culture)

### Power Dynamics

**Studying "Up":**
- Elites, institutions, bureaucracy
- Not powerless "natives"
- Different ethics, access

**Complicity:**
- Anthropologist often shares nationality, privilege with subjects
- Can't claim outsider status

### Theoretical Contributions

**What does European anthropology offer?**

- Complex societies, states, markets
- Nationalism, identity politics
- Secularization, religion
- Immigration, multiculturalism
- Post-socialism
- Modernity, late capitalism

## Early European Ethnography: Peasant Studies

### Mediterranean Anthropology (1950s-1970s)

**Focus:**
- Rural villages (Spain, Italy, Greece, Southern France)
- Peasant agriculture
- Kinship, honor, patronage

**Assumptions:**
- Mediterranean = distinct culture area
- "Honor and shame" complex
- Patron-client relations
- Catholic/Orthodox religion

**Key Works:**

**J.K. Campbell:**
- Sarakatsani shepherds (Greece)
- Honor, family, transhumance

**Julian Pitt-Rivers:**
- Andalusian village (Spain)
- Honor, class, gender

**John Davis:**
- Southern Italy
- Patronage, family

**Critique:**
- Romanticizes "traditional" peasant life
- Ignores modernization, state, capitalism
- "Honor-shame" overgeneralizes (not unique to Mediterranean)

### Eastern Europe (Pre-1989)

**Challenges:**
- Cold War: Limited access for Western anthropologists
- State socialism: Homogenization, surveillance

**Focus:**
- Folklore, rural customs
- Kinship, household
- How people navigate socialism

**Examples:**
- Poland (Galeski, peasant studies)
- Hungary (Fél and Hofer, village studies)
- Romania (Kligman, abortion, nationalism)

---

## Northern and Western Europe

### British Isles

**Ireland:**
- Arensberg and Kimball (*Family and Community in Ireland*, 1940)
- Stem family system (one son inherits farm)
- Delayed marriage (wait for inheritance)

**Scotland:**
- Highland clans, kinship
- Anthony Cohen (Whalsay, Shetland—community, identity)

**England:**
- Anthropology of class (working class, elite)
- Marilyn Strathern (Elmdon, Essex—village study)

### Scandinavia

**Norway:**
- Fredrik Barth (early work, before Middle East)
- Egalitarianism (idealized)

**Sweden:**
- Welfare state
- Ethnicity, immigration

**Iceland:**
- Gísli Pálsson (fishing, gender, nature)

---

## Kinship and Family in Europe

### Diversity

**Not monolithic:**
- Stem family (one heir): Ireland, parts of Germany
- Nuclear family: England, Northern Europe
- Extended family: Southern/Eastern Europe
- Matrifocal (mother-centered): Some urban working-class

**Inheritance:**
- Primogeniture (eldest son): England historically
- Partible (divide among children): France
- Impartible (one heir): stem family systems

### Changes

**Modernization:**
- Urbanization (rural-urban migration)
- Nuclearization (extended → nuclear family)
- Later marriage
- Declining fertility
- Women's workforce participation

**Contemporary:**
- Cohabitation, single-parent households
- Same-sex marriage (legal in many countries)
- Immigration reshapes family forms

---

## Nationalism and Identity

### Nation-States

**Europe = birthplace of modern nationalism:**
- 19th century: nation-state model spreads
- Ethnicity, language, territory = nation
- Homogenization (assimilate minorities)

**Anthropology of Nationalism:**
- Benedict Anderson (*Imagined Communities*): Nation = imagined, constructed
- Invented traditions (Hobsbawm)
- Symbols, rituals, narratives create national identity

### Ethnic Minorities

**Many groups:**
- Basque, Catalan (Spain)
- Bretons (France)
- Sámi (Scandinavia)
- Roma (across Europe)
- Immigrants (colonial legacy, labor migration)

**Roma (Gypsies):**
- Dispersed across Europe (10-12 million)
- Origins: India (migrated 1,000 years ago)
- Marginalized, persecuted (Holocaust, contemporary discrimination)
- Nomadic (historically), now mostly sedentary
- Anthropology: Michael Stewart, Judith Okely

**Basque:**
- Northern Spain, Southern France
- Distinct language (not Indo-European)
- Nationalism (ETA—armed separatism, now disbanded)
- Anthropology: William Douglass

### Regionalism

**Catalonia, Scotland, Flanders:**
- Sub-national identities
- Autonomy movements
- Tension: EU integration vs. regional nationalism

**Anthropology:**
- How do people navigate multiple identities? (Catalan AND Spanish? Scottish AND British?)

---

## Immigration and Multiculturalism

### Post-WWII Migration

**Labor Migration:**
- 1950s-70s: Guest workers (Germany, France, UK)
- Turkey → Germany
- North Africa → France
- South Asia, Caribbean → UK
- Intended temporary, became permanent

**Colonial Legacy:**
- Immigration from former colonies
- Algerians in France, Indians/Pakistanis in UK, Indonesians in Netherlands

**Refugees:**
- 1990s: Balkans (Bosnians, Kosovars)
- 2015: Syrian refugee crisis
- Afghans, Iraqis, others

### Multiculturalism Debates

**Integration vs. Assimilation:**
- Should immigrants assimilate (adopt dominant culture)?
- Or multiculturalism (maintain distinct identities)?

**Backlash:**
- Far-right parties (anti-immigrant)
- "Clash of civilizations" rhetoric (Islam vs. West)
- Integration crises (French banlieues, German Turkish communities)

**Anthropology:**
- Everyday multiculturalism (how people interact across difference)
- Muslim minorities (mosques, hijab, halal)
- Second/third generation (hybrid identities)

**Examples:**
- Steven Vertovec (super-diversity)
- Gerd Baumann (Southall, London—multiculturalism)
- Schirin Amir-Moazami (mosques, Germany)

### Contemporary Divides

**East-West Gap:**

**Anthropology:**
- Migration (Poles to UK, Romanians to Italy)
- EU integration (promises vs. realities)

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** Can European anthropologists truly defamiliarize their own societies, or is "studying up/sideways" fundamentally different from classic ethnography?

**Question 2:** Is "honor and shame" a useful concept for Mediterranean societies, or Orientalist projection?

**Question 3:** How should anthropology address Brexit, Trump, far-right populism—phenomena in "our" societies?

**Question 4:** Is secularization inevitable, or might religion return to prominence in Europe?

**Question 5:** What does European multiculturalism teach us about diversity, integration, and belonging?

**Remember:** European anthropology = "anthropology at home," challenges defamiliarization (familiar societies). Early: peasant studies (Mediterranean honor/shame, patronage), Eastern Europe under socialism. Northern/Western Europe: kinship diversity (stem/nuclear/extended families), nationalism (invented traditions, ethnic minorities Basque/Roma/Sámi). Immigration post-WWII (labor migration, colonial legacy, refugees), multiculturalism debates (integration vs. assimilation, Islamophobia). Post-1989: post-socialist transformations (Verdery Romania, Humphrey Russia, shock therapy, nostalgia, corruption). Religion: secularization (declining Christianity), Islam growing (25M Muslims, controversies), Ireland/Poland/France different trajectories. Class: deindustrialization working class decline, precariat gig economy, studying elites. Urban: London/Paris/Berlin gentrification, banlieues, enclaves. Brexit/Euroscepticism: populism, far-right, sovereignty debates. Anthropologists: Campbell, Pitt-Rivers, Herzfeld, Verdery, Humphrey, Hann, Baumann, Strathern. European anthropology reveals West also diverse, complex, changing—not "modern" monolith.
