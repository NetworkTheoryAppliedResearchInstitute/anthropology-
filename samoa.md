# Samoa: The Most Controversial Ethnography in Anthropology

---

## A Young Woman's Bold Challenge

In 1925, 23-year-old **Margaret Mead** sailed to American Samoa to study adolescent girls. She stayed nine months, learned the language, lived with Samoan families, and interviewed dozens of teenagers.

The book she wrote—***Coming of Age in Samoa* (1928)**—became anthropology's biggest bestseller, transforming public understanding of human nature, adolescence, and culture.

It's also anthropology's most controversial ethnography—debated, defended, attacked, and scrutinized for nearly a century.

**The Question:** What makes adolescence difficult? Is teenage turmoil biological (universal) or cultural (variable)?

**Mead's Answer:** In Samoa, adolescence is easy and smooth. Therefore, teenage angst is cultural, not biological—and American society could be different.

## The Setting: American Samoa

**Location:** South Pacific, Polynesian islands (U.S. territory)

**When Mead Arrived (1925):**
- Under U.S. naval administration since 1900
- Christian missions active since 1830s
- Traditional culture persisting alongside colonial/Christian influences
- Population ~8,000 (Mead studied about 50 adolescent girls on Ta'u island)

**Social Organization:**
- Extended family households (aiga)
- Chiefs (matai) leading families
- Age grades and respect hierarchy
- Complex social etiquette (fa'asamoa—the Samoan way)

**Historical Context:**
- Christianity dominant (Congregational, Catholic, Methodist)
- U.S. control meant schools, stores, naval presence
- Traditional and introduced elements mixing

## Mead's Fieldwork and Findings

### The Research Questions

**Boas (her advisor) asked:**
Is adolescent "storm and stress" universal or culturally specific?

**American Assumptions (1920s):**
- Teenagers are naturally rebellious, moody, difficult
- Puberty causes psychological turmoil
- Parent-child conflict is inevitable
- Sexual desire creates stress and confusion
- Identity crisis is universal

**These were treated as biological facts of human development.**

### What Mead Found in Samoa

> **Samoan Adolescence:**
>
> Mead reported Samoan teenage years were:
> - Casual and easy-going
> - No major parent-child conflicts
> - Sexual experimentation accepted (premarital sex common)
> - Gradual transition to adulthood
> - Little stress or rebellion
> - No identity crisis
> - Girls moved smoothly from childhood through adolescence to adulthood

**Why So Different?**

**Mead's Explanations:**

**1. Sexual Freedom:**
- Premarital sex accepted, even expected
- Young people experimented openly
- No guilt or shame around adolescent sexuality
- Contrast: American repression caused stress

**2. Lack of Choices:**
- Samoan life path relatively determined
- Fewer major life decisions to agonize over
- Less pressure, less stress
- Contrast: American emphasis on individual choice creates anxiety

**3. Extended Family System:**
- Many caregivers, not just parents
- If conflict with one adult, move to another household
- Reduces intensity of parent-child conflict
- Contrast: American nuclear family intensifies conflicts

**4. Diffuse Authority:**
- Authority spread across many adults
- No single dominating parent
- Reduces rebellion need
- Contrast: American parental authority breeds rebellion

**5. Emotional Restraint:**
- Samoans value emotional moderation
- Avoid extremes of feeling
- Casual, even-tempered ideal
- Contrast: American intensity amplifies adolescent drama

### The Argument

**"Coming of Age in Samoa" argued:**

**Nature (Biology):**
- Puberty is biological universal
- Physical changes same everywhere

**Nurture (Culture):**
- Psychological experience of puberty varies culturally
- American adolescent turmoil reflects:
  - Sexual repression
  - Competitive individualism
  - Nuclear family isolation
  - Pressure for achievement
  - Anxiety about choices

**Therefore:**
- Adolescent stress isn't inevitable
- American society creates the problem
- Different childrearing and social organization could reduce teenage difficulties

## The Freeman Controversy (1983)

**Derek Freeman's Attack:**

Australian anthropologist Derek Freeman published *Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth* (1983)—devastating critique of Mead.

### Freeman's Charges:

**1. Deception:**
- Mead's informants lied to her
- They told her what she wanted to hear
- Adolescent "sexual freedom" was informants' joke
- Mead too naïve to recognize deception

**2. Wrong About Samoa:**
Freeman (who did fieldwork in Samoa 1940s-1960s) claimed:
- Samoans are sexually repressive, not free
- Violence and jealousy over sex are common
- Adolescence IS stressful in Samoa
- Rape and punishment for premarital sex exist
- Virginity highly valued, especially for ceremonial virgins (taupou)

**3. Ideological Bias:**
- Mead wanted to prove culture over biology
- Saw what she expected to see
- Ignored contrary evidence
- Cultural determinism blinded her

**4. Methodological Problems:**
- Only 9 months fieldwork
- Limited language fluency
- Relied on few informants
- Didn't witness much of what she described

### The Anthropological Response

**Defense of Mead:**

**1. Freeman's Own Bias:**
- Freeman was biological determinist (wanted to prove biology, not culture, matters)
- Had ideological ax to grind
- His Samoa fieldwork was decades later (different time)
- He studied different village, different island

**2. Mead Wasn't Entirely Wrong:**
- Samoan sexuality more open than 1920s America (even if not completely free)
- Extended family system does reduce parent-child intensity
- Adolescence varies culturally (core point stands)

**3. Freeman's Evidence Questionable:**
- His informants also had agendas
- He interviewed during more repressive period (post-missionary influence)
- Samoa changed between 1920s and 1960s

**4. Cultural Change:**
- 1920s Samoa (Mead) vs. 1960s Samoa (Freeman) = different
- Increased Christian influence
- More rigid sexual norms
- Both could be partially right about different times

**5. Gender Matters:**
- Mead talked to women; Freeman talked to men
- Men and women might describe sexuality differently
- Gendered perspective affects what you learn

### The Ongoing Debate

**No Clear Resolution:**

Anthropologists remain divided:

**Some Defend Mead:**
- Core argument (culture shapes adolescence) remains valid
- Freeman exaggerated his case
- Mead's portrait has truth even if idealized

**Some Side with Freeman:**
- Mead did idealize Samoa
- Sexual freedom exaggerated
- Methods problematic

**Many Take Middle Ground:**
- Both had biases
- Both captured partial truths
- Samoa is complex; different experiences coexist
- Ethnographic truth is complicated

## What We Learn from the Controversy

### 1. Ethnographic Authority Is Contested

**No Singular Truth:**
- Multiple anthropologists studying same place find different things
- Perspective, timing, methods matter
- "Objective" ethnography is impossible
- But this doesn't mean anything goes—evidence matters

### 2. Fieldwork Limitations

**Even Best Fieldwork Has Issues:**
- Limited time
- Language barriers
- Informants may mislead (intentionally or not)
- Observer affects observed
- Personal biases shape seeing

### 3. Culture Changes

**Can't Study "Traditional" Samoa:**
- 1920s Samoa already influenced by missions, colonialism
- Continues changing
- No pristine, unchanging culture to document

### 4. Political Stakes

**Ethnography Has Consequences:**
- Nature vs. nurture debates affect policy
- If biology determines behavior, can't change it
- If culture determines behavior, can change it
- Both Mead and Freeman had political agendas

### 5. Gender and Perspective

**Who You Talk To Matters:**
- Men and women experience culture differently
- Young and old see things differently
- Position affects knowledge

## Beyond the Controversy: Mead's Broader Contributions

### Other Samoa Work

**"Social Organization of Manu'a" (1930):**
More technical, detailed ethnography of Samoan social structure, kinship, politics. Less controversial, more respected by scholars.

### Other Fieldwork

**New Guinea Studies:**
- Arapesh, Mundugumor, Tchambuli (Chambri)
- *Sex and Temperament* (1935): Gender roles vary culturally
- *Growing Up in New Guinea* (1930): Child development cross-culturally

### Public Intellectual Role

**Mead Used Anthropology to:**
- Challenge American assumptions
- Support progressive causes
- Promote tolerance and understanding
- Advocate for women's rights
- Influence policy and education

**Legacy:**
Made anthropology publicly visible and relevant. Showed anthropology could critique one's own society.

## Samoa Today

**Modern Samoa:**

**Two Samoas:**
- Independent Samoa (formerly Western Samoa)
- American Samoa (U.S. territory)

**Contemporary Issues:**
- Migration to U.S., New Zealand, Australia
- Maintaining fa'asamoa (Samoan way) in diaspora
- Christianity dominant
- Economic development challenges
- Climate change impacts (rising seas)
- Balancing tradition and modernity

**Fa'afafine:**
Third gender role (people assigned male at birth living as women) shows Samoan gender complexity beyond Western binaries.

**Samoans' Views of Mead:**

Mixed reactions:
- Some appreciate her attention to Samoa
- Others resent being made famous for "sexual freedom"
- Many feel Western academics debate them without including them

---

## Contemporary Relevance

### What Remains from Mead's Work:

**Core Insight:**
Culture profoundly shapes development, including adolescence. Biology isn't destiny.

**Cross-Cultural Comparison:**
Comparing societies reveals what's cultural vs. universal.

**Critique of Own Society:**
Anthropology can challenge taken-for-granted assumptions.

### What We Reject:

**Cultural Determinism:**
Mead sometimes overclaimed culture's power. Biology and culture both matter.

**Idealizing Other Cultures:**
Portraying Samoa as paradise vs. problematic America is problematic.

**Simple Nature vs. Nurture:**
False dichotomy—nature AND nurture interact complexly.

## Provocations for Thought

**Question 1:** If Mead was partially wrong about Samoa, does that invalidate her core argument about culture shaping adolescence?

**Question 2:** Why do you think the Mead-Freeman debate became so heated? What was really at stake?

**Question 3:** Is it possible to write "objective" ethnography, or is every ethnography positioned, partial, and political?

**Question 4:** Should anthropologists idealize the societies they study to critique their own, or does this do disservice to both?

**Question 5:** If both Mead and Freeman had biases, how do we determine which ethnographic claims to trust?

**Remember:** The Samoa controversy teaches humility about ethnographic knowledge. No ethnography captures complete, objective truth. Every account is partial, positioned, historically situated. But this doesn't mean ethnography is worthless—it means we must read critically, consider multiple perspectives, acknowledge limitations, and recognize political stakes. Mead's core insight—that culture profoundly shapes human development and psychology—remains valid even if her specific portrait of Samoa was idealized. The debate reminds us that anthropology is always interpretive, always political, always incomplete. This isn't failure—it's the nature of human knowledge about human diversity.
